<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> bedroom door opened and closed on
its oiled hinges without a sound, and a
man walked over to the closet. With
methodical care he hung his coat on its accustomed
peg before moving deliberately over to his
bureau. On its highly polished top he laid down
a soiled scrap of paper. His quiet, orderly actions
gave no indication of the rage consuming
him. As he raised his head his eyes traveled upward
and he started back involuntarily at the face
contemplating him in the mirror. His face&mdash;but
was that distorted countenance his face?
With a shudder he glanced over his shoulder and
about the room; then slowly, fearfully he turned
to face his other self mirrored in the glass before
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Judith Richards poked the fire into a brighter
blaze, then leaned back in her chair with a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>sigh of content and idly turned over the pages of
the book she had been reading. The happy ending
recorded in the romance reflected her own
mood. Two months a bride! Her lips parted
in a tender smile as events of her happy married
life recurred to her, and dropping the book in her
lap, she rested her head against the tufted chair
and watched the burning logs in dreamy contemplation.
She was not conscious of the lateness
of the hour or of the fact that she was no longer
alone in the large library.</p>

<p>The newcomer who had entered noiselessly
through the portières hanging before the doorway
leading from the library into the dining room,
moved cautiously forward to obtain a better view
of Judith. Satisfied that he had not disturbed her
reverie, he sidled stealthily over to a large safe,
which stood near a mahogany desk, and dropped
on his knees before it.</p>

<p>Without rising from his crouching position, he
pushed forward a chair until its broad proportions
completely sheltered his movements should Judith
turn around and glance in his direction; then, losing
no further time, he twirled the dial of the safe
around with practiced fingers, and as the massive
door finally swung open he went systematically
through each compartment of the safe. Fully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>twenty minutes passed and the man moistened his
dry lips. Was his search to go unrewarded?</p>

<p>As he felt about in the last compartment to be
examined his fingers encountered a piece of paper
caught apparently in a crevice. With infinite care
he pulled it loose, and rising, walked over to the
electric-light bracket on the wall by the door
through which he had entered the library. One
of the bulbs was burning, and as he bent his head
to examine the piece of paper, his eyes caught the
flash of steel as it darted through the portières,
and he instinctively recoiled&mdash;but too late to
avoid the thrust. With a whimpering cry he fell
face downward, his blood staining the handsome
rugs.</p>

<p>Judith stirred and sat up, then after a comfortable
stretch of her stiffened muscles, she replaced
her book on the table, and with a glance at the
mantel clock, paused to warm her hands at the
smoldering embers.</p>

<p>It was much later than she had supposed&mdash;one
o’clock. With a faint shiver she pulled her dainty
warm wrapper more closely about her slender figure
before leaning over to switch off the reading
lamp. Picking up her large sewing bag she
walked across the library intending to press the
wall button which controlled the electric side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>lights. But her intention was forgotten as her
sleepy eyes caught sight of the crumpled figure
lying in front of the entrance to the dining room.</p>

<p>A cry broke from her and slowly her shocked
wits took in the significance of the ever widening
red stain creeping across the rugs and floor. For
long seconds she stood staring, too terrified to
move. Gradually gathering courage, she advanced
and, placing one trembling hand on the
man’s shoulder, rolled him over until his face
was exposed to view. With a bound she regained
her feet, her hands raised to her throbbing
temples, while the sewing bag tumbled unheeded
to the floor.</p>

<p>She was unaware of the passing time as she
gazed at the face before her, a face scarcely less
gray in death than her own, from which every ray
of color had been stricken. Slowly, slowly she
took in every detail of the man’s appearance, then
with numb, clumsy fingers she jerked a long pair
of steel shears from her sewing bag and, kneeling
down once more by the dead man, she hacked and
tore at his watch chain until she had loosened a
small locket.</p>

<p>Slipping the locket inside her belt and clutching
the sewing bag, she staggered to her feet and
made her way into the large central hall as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>key turned in the front door and a man stepped
inside the house.</p>

<p>“Joe! Thank God!” Judith’s low cry
ended abruptly, and her husband was just in time
to catch her as she fell unconscious to the floor.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>etective Ferguson</span> laid an
impatient finger on the bell of the front
door of the Hale residence and, removing
his hat, fanned himself vigorously. Coroner
Penfield’s message had been imperative and, the
Headquarters’ car having been out on an errand,
he had commandeered a “bike” which a patrolman
had left in the outer hallway, and had pedaled
uptown as rapidly as possible. The unwonted
exertion, as well as his intense curiosity, had both
served to excite him. What untoward circumstances
had required his immediate presence at
three in the morning at the home of Robert Hale,
eminent scientist and respected citizen of the
National Capital?</p>

<p>The detective’s wonderment grew as the front
door flew back and he stepped over its threshold
into the semidarkness of the large central hall of
the house. The stillness was broken by a low-voiced
direction, and Ferguson, peering around,
saw a man, his presence partly concealed behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>the open front door, watching him. The man
shut the door with such care that it made no
sound.</p>

<p>“Come this way,” he repeated, and Ferguson,
with an instinctive bow, realized he was addressed
by a member of the household and not a servant.
Checking his impulse to ask questions, the detective
followed his guide across the hall and into a
brilliantly lighted room. The sudden transition
from semidarkness caused Ferguson to blink owlishly,
and he paused abruptly on hearing the faint
click of the folding doors, through which they
had entered, being closed behind them.</p>

<p>“Coroner Penfield is over there,” stated his
guide, and Ferguson, grown more accustomed to
the light, looked in the direction indicated just as
Penfield rose from his stooping position and
turned toward him. The coroner’s expression
changed at sight of the detective and he beckoned
him to approach. An instant later and Ferguson
was staring down at the figure of a man lying
partly turned upon his back. Penfield pointed to
the small wound over the heart and to the ashen
cheeks and staring eyes.</p>

<p>“Dead,” he said, tersely. “Stabbed.”</p>

<p>Ferguson whistled low, shot one questioning
look at the coroner, and then turned his attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>to the dead man and the room. With minute
care he examined the body and then scanned the
library. There was no indication of a struggle
having taken place, no chairs or tables were overturned.
Ferguson paused in perplexity&mdash;the
orderly appearance of the room surprised him;
his eyes ran up and down the book-lined walls,
over the handsome curtains drawn across the deep
window alcoves, and the drawn portières&mdash;the
furnishing of the library was a key to the wealth
and good taste of its owner, but as the background
for the scene of a tragedy it failed lamentably
to give any clew to it or answer his yet
unasked questions.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor,” he turned to the coroner,
“who’s the dead man and who stabbed him?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Penfield addressed the
third man in the library who, since admitting the
detective, had remained a silent witness of their
investigations.</p>

<p>“Major Richards,” he began, “kindly repeat
just what you told me on my arrival,” and seating
himself at a convenient table, he drew out
a fountain pen and a memorandum pad.
“Major Joseph Richards,” he added by way of
explanation, “is Mr. Hale’s son-in-law, Ferguson.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>Richards acknowledged the detective’s jerky
bow at mention of his name with a grave inclination
of his head.</p>

<p>“The information I can give you is meager,”
he stated, and Ferguson, sensitive to first impressions,
grew conscious of an undercurrent of agitation
admirably controlled by Richards’ deliberation
of speech; only a longer acquaintance would
tell whether such was characteristic of him. “I
returned from the club about twenty minutes past
one, found my wife”&mdash;his hesitation was almost
imperceptible&mdash;“indisposed, and on coming
in here later to look for a bottle of bromide
which she had left on the library table, I discovered”&mdash;</p>

<p>He stopped, and an eloquent gesture completed
his sentence.</p>

<p>“You found the room occupied,” supplemented
the coroner practically. “Was the man dead or
alive?” and the look he shot at Richards under
his shaggy brows was penetrating.</p>

<p>“The man was dead.” Richards’ eyelids
flickered somewhat. “At least I judged so from
my superficial knowledge of medical matters. I
certainly did not kill him.”</p>

<p>Penfield let pass a certain flippant hardness
which had crept into Richards’ manner, and Ferguson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
who had worked with the coroner in many
criminal cases, followed his cue.</p>

<p>“What was your next action, Major
Richards?” Penfield inquired.</p>

<p>“I returned to my wife and gave her the medicine,
then slipped downstairs and called you up,”
was the concise reply. “You came and instructed
me to send for Detective Ferguson, and after
doing so, I awaited his arrival and brought him
here.”</p>

<p>“Did you inform your wife of your gruesome
discovery in the library?” inquired Penfield.</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“My wife was already in a highly nervous
state, and I feared she would become ill if further
excited,” Richards explained.</p>

<p>Penfield frowned at his note pad. “What had
made her nervous?”</p>

<p>“A motor accident in the early afternoon,”
quietly. “Her electric was run into by a taxicab,
and while no one was hurt, she suffered from
fright and shock.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” commented Penfield, his manner
somewhat sympathetic, and would have added
more, but Detective Ferguson, tired of the rôle
of listener, broke in brusquely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Who is the dead man, Major Richards?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“I do not know.” The low-spoken answer
was firm and Richards’ gaze did not waver before
their stares. The detective was the first to
look away.</p>

<p>“I see, a case of ordinary burglary,” he said,
moving to the dead man. “He’s wearing a dark
suit, good quality cloth, however, and rubber
heeled shoes.” He transferred his gaze to the
safe, only partly visible from where he stood owing
to the position of a large, tufted lounging
chair. “Ah,” striding over to it, he laid his
hand on the levers and the door swung open without
resistance. “It’s unlocked; evidently the
burglar got it open before&mdash;” He checked his
hasty speech and faced Richards who had watched
his rapid movements with interest. “Who owns
this safe?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Robert Hale.”</p>

<p>“Is it usually left unlocked?”</p>

<p>“I believe not.”</p>

<p>“You believe not”&mdash;the detective caught
him up quickly. “Are you not familiar with Mr.
Hale’s habits?”</p>

<p>“No,” regarding him steadily. “My wife and
I returned from our wedding journey only two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>weeks ago. We are at present the guests of her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hale. During our
visit I have not,” with quiet emphasis, “familiarized
myself, as you put it, with Mr. Hale’s habits,
but I once overheard him tell his wife that he never
left the safe unlocked.”</p>

<p>Ferguson stooped down and examined the safe
with careful attention.</p>

<p>“The lock’s not been forced,” he muttered.
“It looks like the job of an expert safe cracker,
or”&mdash;with an upward glance at Richards&mdash;“some
one familiar with the combination.”</p>

<p>“The Rogues’ Gallery will aid in identifying
the dead man if he is a ‘regular,’” broke in
Coroner Penfield. “But who killed the burglar?”
He looked across at Richards. “Who
is in this house besides you and your wife?”</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Hale have residing with them,
besides my wife and myself, Mr. Hale’s younger
brother, John Hale,” Richards answered.
“There are a number of servants who also sleep
in the house.”</p>

<p>Penfield consulted his note pad. “Did you
go for Mr. Hale or his brother on finding the
dead man?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hale and her brother-in-law are at a
reception given by the French Ambassador and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>his wife,” responded Richards. “They have not
yet returned.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Robert Hale&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Is ill in bed,” Richards perched himself on
the arm of a chair. “When I rushed upstairs
with the medicine for my wife I went first to Mr.
Hale’s bedroom and, on finding him asleep, withdrew
as quietly as possible.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you summon the servants?” asked
Penfield.</p>

<p>“I did not.” Observing the look of surprise on
their faces, he added, “The servants are women.
I did not wish to terrify them with this sight,”
and he waved his hand in the direction of the
dead man.</p>

<p>Penfield reflected a moment, and in the brief
interval Ferguson took mental note of Major
Richards’ fine physique and strongly molded features.
He did not look the man to lose his head
in an emergency; on the contrary, his self-possession
and poise made a favorable impression on
both the men watching him so intently. Richards
was about to speak again when Penfield held up
his hand.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” he cautioned. “Let me get
this straight. You reached this house about
twenty minutes after one this morning; Mrs. Hale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>and her brother-in-law are still at the French
Embassy reception, leaving at home Mr. Hale,
ill in bed, your wife, and the female servants.
An unidentified man enters the house in your
absence and upon your return you find him
dead in the library. Did you hear voices or retreating
footsteps when you came in the front
door?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you meet any one when on your way
to your wife’s room?”</p>

<p>“No.” Richards’ eyes did not falter in their
direct gaze at the coroner. He confined his replies
to monosyllables.</p>

<p>“Strange!” Penfield walked back and stood
looking down at the dead man. “Very strange.
I have made only a superficial examination, Major
Richards, but I’ll stake my reputation that that
wound was not self-inflicted. The man was
stabbed”&mdash;he paused and his voice deepened&mdash;“murdered.”</p>

<p>The lines in Richards’ face showed more plainly
as he set his square jaw at a determined angle.
“The killing of a burglar is generally considered
justifiable homicide,” he said sternly. “It is
one’s right to protect one’s property from midnight
marauders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Who protected Mr. Hale’s home in this instance?”
demanded Ferguson.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you that,” responded Richards.
“But, Mr. Coroner, until you know further details
of how this man came to his death, you
cannot proclaim it a murder committed by an
inmate of this household.”</p>

<p>“I proclaim nothing,” denied Penfield. “On
the contrary, I am first most anxious to question
the servants, Mr. Hale, and your wife&mdash;the only
people, according to your statement, at home when
this man was killed&mdash;and find out if possible
what transpired here in your absence.”</p>

<p>“You cannot do that now,” interposed Richards
hastily. “Mr. Hale and my wife are not in condition
to be interviewed at this hour&mdash;later in
the day, perhaps”&mdash;Ferguson gave a gesture of
dissent.</p>

<p>“And in the meantime,” he interposed harshly,
“the murderer will slip through our fingers, and
every clew grow cold.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” replied Richards warmly.
“You are at liberty to examine this floor and
the basement at the present time, only I must insist
that you do not disturb either my wife or Mr.
Hale.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.” Ferguson turned toward the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>folding doors leading to the central hall.
“Where are the servants’ bedrooms?”</p>

<p>“On the third floor.” At the words the detective
vanished.</p>

<p>Richards rose from his perch on the chair arm
and paced slowly up and down the library. Penfield,
paying no attention to his movements, knelt
down by the dead man and with infinite care
went through his pockets. His search produced
some loose change, a bill-folder containing nearly
a hundred dollars, and a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>“Not much help for identification purposes,”
he remarked dryly, as Richards halted by his side.
“He was a handsome fellow; women rave over
that type of beauty in a man. He looks a gentleman&mdash;high-bred,
and all that.”</p>

<p>“He could not have been in destitute circumstances,”
commented Richards, pointing to the
Treasury bills.</p>

<p>“Hm&mdash;yes,” Penfield looked thoughtful.
“It might be that he rifled this money from Mr.
Hale’s safe.” He wheeled suddenly on Richards.
“What did Mr. Hale keep in his safe?”</p>

<p>“You will have to ask Mr. Hale,” answered
Richards composedly. “I am ignorant of his
affairs.”</p>

<p>Penfield stroked his chin slowly; Richards as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>a source of information was a disappointment.
Should he not insist upon seeing Mr. Hale, illness
or no illness, unconventional hour or not?
Valuable time was slipping away and he was no
nearer vital information than at the moment of
his arrival&mdash;over an hour had elapsed since receiving
his hasty summons. Penfield stood up.</p>

<p>“By the way, Major,” he began, “as you are
a stranger in Washington and did not ask the advice
of others”&mdash;with a quick side-long scrutiny
of which Richards appeared unaware&mdash;“how
did it happen that you called me on the telephone
first and not the police?”</p>

<p>For answer Richards strode over to the table
near the fireplace and, picking up the evening
newspaper which lay spread across it, pointed
to a column of news bearing display type.</p>

<p>“I had been reading earlier in the evening
this account of the Fuller inquest,” he explained.
“Your name is given, Coroner Penfield, and it
also stated that the body of the dead woman
could not be moved until you had arrived on the
scene; therefore,” calmly, “I judged that you
would be of more immediate aid than the police.
It was a simple matter to find your number in
the telephone directory.”</p>

<p>“True.” Penfield considered a moment, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>moved restlessly over to the safe. Without removing
the contents of its compartments he took
careful note of such papers and objects as came
within his view. He was still gazing steadily
at them when the portières before the dining room
parted and Ferguson stepped again into the room.</p>

<p>“Every window on this floor and the basement
is locked on the inside,” he announced. “And I
also examined those on the landings of the stairs
and the hall of the second floor.”</p>

<p>“You went upstairs?” Richards moved toward
him, his jaw set at an angry angle. “After
what I told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” There was open defiance in the detective’s
manner. “I looked only in the rooms
where the doors were open,” he turned and addressed
Penfield. “So far as I could discover,
there is no trace of the burglar’s having gained
entrance through forcing a window or door.”</p>

<p>“No trace of any one’s lurking downstairs?”
demanded Penfield.</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Found any weapon?”</p>

<p>“No.” Ferguson’s tone was glum. His gaze,
shifting about the room, happened to light on
Richards and he saw him start and stiffen in a
listening attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Ferguson’s eyes brightened, and he checked
further speech. Suddenly he caught the sound of
a soft footfall and, as Richards started forward,
he interposed his bulky form between him and
the folding doors as they were pushed apart and
Judith Richards stepped into the library. With
a shove which sent the detective sprawling,
Richards gained his wife’s side.</p>

<p>“Why have you come down, dearest?” he
asked tenderly, bending his head until his mouth
almost touched her ear.</p>

<p>She shook her head, as her hand crept into his
and leaned her weight on his protecting arm.</p>

<p>“I came down to find,” she commenced, and
her soft voice, though low-pitched, reached the
two listening men, then she stopped in fright as,
moving slightly forward, she caught a glimpse
over Richards’ shoulder of Penfield regarding
her. “Joe&mdash;who is that?”</p>

<p>“Ah, eh&mdash;” Richards stammered, then caught
himself up. “It is Mr. Penfield, dearest.” She
raised her eyes and regarded him closely, and
more slowly he repeated, “Dr. Penfield.”</p>

<p>She shook her head in bewilderment, and drew
her silk wrapper more closely about her; the movement
brought into view the large sewing bag suspended
by its cord from her wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“I came down to find,” she commenced
again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know,” broke in Ferguson from his seat
on the floor where his encounter with Richards’
muscular figure had landed him. His tumble had
disarranged the rug and under its lifted folds he
had caught the gleam of light on metal. With
impetuous fingers he drew out a pair of long steel
shears and held them aloft. “You left a dead
man here and came back to find your bloodstained
shears.”</p>

<p>An oath ripped from Richards and he made a
step forward, but Judith’s clinging hand detained
him. She reeled against him as she caught sight
of the shears, and he held her closely; his voice,
though low, vibrated with passion.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;Ferguson!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded the detective. “I am
not interested in your statements, Major Richards;
let your wife answer my last remark.”</p>

<p>“Answer!” Richards choked; then spoke more
clearly. “You &mdash;&mdash; fool! My wife has not
heard a word you said&mdash;she is stone deaf.”</p>

<p>Ferguson and Coroner Penfield stared dumfounded
at husband and wife. The latter was the
first to break the strained silence.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, gentlemen,” she said, and her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>deprecating look, as well as charming voice, conveyed
an apology, “I cannot understand what
you are saying.” She raised her eyes and gazed
perplexedly at her husband. “Joe, I came down
to get my ear trumpet.”</p>

<p>Penfield recovered from his surprise. “It is
here, madam,” he exclaimed and hurrying to the
safe picked up the instrument from one of the
compartments and handed it to Judith. With
quick deft fingers she adjusted it to her ear and
then Ferguson addressed her.</p>

<p>“Now, madam, perhaps you will explain&mdash;don’t
interfere, Major Richards&mdash;I must have
an explanation&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so must I.” The interruption came in
an unexpected quarter, and both Penfield and the
detective wheeled toward the hall door. “What
is the meaning of this scene in my house, gentlemen?”
Mrs. Hale, tossing her ermine cape on
the nearest chair, advanced to the little group,
followed by her brother-in-law, John Hale.</p>

<p>Penfield spoke before the others.</p>

<p>“A crime has been committed here to-night,
madam, in your absence,” he began.</p>

<p>“A crime?” She interrupted in her turn, her
eyes leaving her daughter’s blanched face for the
first time. “A crime&mdash;?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>“Yes; a burglar forced an entrance and was
murdered&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A burglar!” John Hale pushed past his
sister-in-law to the center of the room. His
manner was rough and domineering. “What
the devil are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Without answering, Ferguson wheeled about
and, walking over to the motionless figure on the
floor, signed to Hale to approach.</p>

<p>“Here’s the burglar&mdash;and he’s dead,” he announced
concisely, then held up the shears, “and
here’s the weapon&mdash;from a workbag,” casting
a significant glance at the bag still suspended from
Judith’s icy fingers. Richards’ furious retort was
checked by a cry of horror from John Hale.</p>

<p>With staring eyes and ghastly face he gazed
down at the dead man.</p>

<p>“A burglar!” he cried. “Austin&mdash;my son!”
and pitched headlong to the floor.</p>

<span class="smaller">THEORIES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Hale</span> rattled her coffee cups and
looked over the top of her silver urn
at Joe Richards; he had asked for a
third cup of coffee and he drank it clear. Mrs.
Hale was shocked. But the remonstrance on the
tip of her tongue died unspoken as she studied
his clear-cut profile and observed the dogged set
to his determined jaw. She took silent note of his
unusual pallor, the dark circles under his eyes,
and his continued silence. Mrs. Hale felt resentful;
she was of a talkative disposition and
had welcomed an opportunity to discuss the mystery
surrounding Austin Hale’s death with her
handsome son-in-law, but instead of following
her lead he had answered in monosyllables. A
less persistent woman would have given up the
attempt.</p>

<p>“Did you ask Judith if she saw a light in
Austin’s bedroom?” she inquired, for at least the
sixth time. “Your suite of rooms is directly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>under his, poor boy,” and she sought refuge behind
her damp handkerchief. She emerged a moment
later to add, “Austin must have gone to
his room, for his overcoat and suit case were there
when I went upstairs after that distressing scene
in the library&mdash;dear me, was it only this morning?”</p>

<p>“It was.” Richards’ tone was grim and did
not invite further remarks. For a moment there
was silence.</p>

<p>“You haven’t answered my question, my dear
boy,” prompted Mrs. Hale plaintively, “nor have
you touched your breakfast!” in shocked surprise
as Anna, the waitress, removed his plate.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I cannot eat.” With an effort Richards
suppressed a grimace at sight of the untasted
eggs and bacon. “I have no appetite. Dear
Mrs. Hale, do not distress yourself on my account.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale regarded him in suspicious silence;
she was not quite certain what prompted his
sudden change of manner. Was he poking fun
at her? But as she met his unwavering gaze she
dismissed the idea as unworthy, and returned
valiantly to the task of eliciting information.</p>

<p>“What questions <i>did</i> you ask Judith?” she
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“I have not questioned Judith.” Richards
drew out his cigarette case. “May I smoke?”
And hardly waiting for her permission, he added,
“Judith, as you know, does not feel well and is
breakfasting in her boudoir. I do not believe,”&mdash;Richards
paused and his speech gained added
deliberation&mdash;“I do not believe Judith can supply
any information as to the events of last night,
nor any clew to the unfortunate murder of her
cousin. Her deafness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know,” broke in Mrs. Hale hastily&mdash;any
allusion to Judith’s infirmity cut her mother love.
“I cannot think why, when Austin reached home,
he did not at once tell Judith that he was in the
house&mdash;he knew she could not <i>hear</i> him enter.
It is most surprising!” and Mrs. Hale shook
a puzzled head.</p>

<p>Richards considered her thoughtfully. “Have
you found out how and when Austin returned
last night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course.” Mrs. Hale brightened; Richards
was at last expanding to the extent of asking
questions&mdash;what had made him so morose? “I
interviewed the servants immediately after leaving
the library.” She did not add that she had
scurried upstairs in dire haste so as to be the
first person to go to their rooms and personally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>question each and every one&mdash;thereby upsetting
Detective Ferguson’s well-laid plans, and depriving
the servants of any sleep during the remainder
of the night. “Not one of them,” impressively,
“knew of his return.”</p>

<p>“Then how did he get in?” persisted Richards.</p>

<p>“With his latchkey, of course,” somewhat surprised
by Richards’ manner. “Oh, I forgot, you
did not know Austin, and perhaps we have not
mentioned that he has always made his home
with us since his adoption.”</p>

<p>“His what?” Richards’ voice rose in astonishment;
and Mrs. Hale’s complacent smile reflected
her gratification; she had at last aroused
Richards’ interest. “Do you mean&mdash;was he
not John Hale’s son?”</p>

<p>“No, only his stepson,” she explained. “John
married a widow, Cora Price, much older than
himself, when he was but twenty-four&mdash;in fact
just out of college. John is only forty-seven
now, ten years my husband’s junior. Dear me,
where was I?” and Mrs. Hale pulled up short,
conscious that she had wandered from the point.</p>

<p>“You were speaking of Austin’s adoption,”
Richards reminded her gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Cora had a boy by her first husband,
and when she died within the year of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>marriage, she left him, then about five years of
age, to John to bring up, and he legally adopted
him, giving him our name. John,” she added,
“is very kind-hearted, if somewhat hasty in his
actions.”</p>

<p>Reminded of his cigarette by his burned fingers,
Richards dropped the stub in his coffee cup
and started to light another just as Maud, the
parlor maid, appeared in the dining room.</p>

<p>“Detective Ferguson has called to see Mr.
John,” she announced, addressing Mrs. Hale.
“Do you know when he will return, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” Mrs. Hale pushed back her chair
and rose with alacrity. “Where is the detective?”</p>

<p>“In the library, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Show him into the drawing-room,” Mrs.
Hale directed, and not giving Richards an opportunity
to pull back the portières before the entrance
to the large room which adjoined the dining room
on the west, she swept majestically away.</p>

<p>“Maud!” The parlor maid halted as
Richards’ low voice reached her. “Did my wife
eat her breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a little.” Maud’s sympathetic
smile blossomed forth as she caught Richards’
pleased expression. She lingered before speeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
on her errand to the waiting detective. “Miss
Judith has brightened considerable since I gave
her Miss Polly’s answer.”</p>

<p>Richards’ strong hand caressed his clean-shaven
chin. “And what was the answer?” he questioned.
“Verbal?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; James brought back word that
Miss Polly would be right over, and so I told
Miss Judith.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Maud,” and the parlor maid felt
rewarded by Richards’ charming smile.</p>

<p>Richards had become a favorite with the servants,
who idolized “Miss Judith,” as they still
persisted in calling her. They had awaited with
interest the arrival of the bride and groom two
weeks before, an interest intensified by the storm
which had arisen on receipt of Judith’s cablegram
to her father telling of her marriage in far-away
Japan to Joseph Richards.</p>

<p>Robert Hale had made no attempt to conceal
or modify his fury while Mrs. Hale, deeply hurt
by what she termed her “unfilial conduct,” had
promptly made the best of the situation and endeavored
to persuade her husband to accept the
inevitable and cable Judith their forgiveness.
Hale, anxious to return to his scientific experiments,
finally succumbed to her arguments, backed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>up by those of his brother John, and, going a
step further than his wife had expected, added
an invitation to return to the paternal roof.</p>

<p>Richards had borne himself well under the inspection
of his wife’s family, and Hale had grudgingly
admitted to his wife that perhaps he wasn’t
such a bad lot after all, to which Mrs. Hale,
who had been won by Richards’ charm of manner
and handsome presence, had indignantly responded
that Judith had been most fortunate in
her selection of a husband. Hale’s only response
had been a sardonic grin.</p>

<p>As the parlor maid hurried down the hall,
Richards paused in thought; Mrs. Hale had not
invited him to go with her to the drawing-room,
but&mdash;with bent head he meditatively paced up
and down, his steps involuntarily carrying him
nearer and nearer the portières; as he paused
irresolutely before them, Mrs. Hale’s voice came
to him clearly.</p>

<p>“Detective Ferguson, I must insist on an answer to
my question.”</p>

<p>Richards jerked the portières aside and without
ceremony entered the drawing-room. Ferguson
turned at sound of his footsteps and bowed to
him before answering Mrs. Hale who was regarding
him with fixed attention.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<p>“I can’t tell you anything, Mrs. Hale,” he
protested. “I came here to get information.”</p>

<p>“What information?” Mrs. Hale had
frowned at sight of Richards, then, her momentary
displeasure gone, addressed herself to the
detective. She enjoyed the rôle of inquisitor.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk with Mr. John Hale.”</p>

<p>“He is out.”</p>

<p>“So your maid said.” Ferguson fingered the
table ornaments with restless fingers; he was getting
nowhere and time was slipping away.
“Where’s he gone?”</p>

<p>Richards answered the question. “To the
cemetery, I understood him to say.” He glanced
at his watch. “Mr. Hale should be back in a
very short time.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait, Major,” and Ferguson, who
had secretly resented Mrs. Hale’s discourtesy in
not asking him to be seated, jerked forward a
chair and threw himself into it. “Can I see
your husband, madam?”</p>

<p>“You cannot.” Mrs. Hale rapped out the reply,
and Richards shot a quick look of inquiry in
her direction. “My husband is under Dr. McLane’s
care, and until the doctor gives permission
he cannot be interviewed.”</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane,” repeated Ferguson, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>face brightened. “The doctor came in just before
I did. Will you please send him word that
I would like to see him before he leaves?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale considered for a brief second, then
turned to Richards who was standing near the
mantel. “Please touch the bell for Maud,” and
as he did so, she again spoke to Ferguson.</p>

<p>“Why do you desire to see my husband?”
she asked, and her manner had regained its usual
suavity.</p>

<p>“To question him regarding the occurrences of
last night,” answered Ferguson. “Have you already
done so?” and he eyed her keenly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale shook her head, but before she
could otherwise reply, Maud came into the room.</p>

<p>“Ask Dr. McLane to come here before he
leaves,” she directed. “Tell him that Detective
Ferguson and I both wish to see him,” and Maud
vanished. Mrs. Hale settled herself back in her
chair and regarded Ferguson attentively. There
was a bull-dog air about the detective that warned
her he was not to be trifled with. In spite of
her haphazard characteristics and total lack of
tact, she recognized determination in the opposite
sex, though never giving in to her own.</p>

<p>“What did you ask me, Mr. Ferguson?” she
inquired sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Have you told your husband of the death of
Austin Hale?” Ferguson put the direct question
with quiet emphasis, and she answered it in kind.</p>

<p>“I have not,” adding before he could speak,
“My husband was asleep when I went to our
rooms after my interview with you this morning,
and when he awoke two hours ago he complained
of feeling feverish, so I forbore breaking the
news to him until after Dr. McLane’s visit.”</p>

<p>Ferguson scrutinized her narrowly; he was not
prepossessed in her favor and from the little he
had seen of her wondered that she should have
refrained from telling her husband of the tragedy
of the early morning, for he judged her to be
the type of woman who must talk at all costs.
That she had not told her husband implied&mdash;&mdash; The
detective’s cogitations were interrupted by
the entrance of John Hale and a companion whom
Ferguson instantly recognized from the frequent
publication of his photograph in the local papers.</p>

<p>Francis Latimer, senior member of the firm of
Latimer and House, stockbrokers, was one of
the popular bachelors of Washington. Inclined
to embonpoint, of medium height, a little bald,
and wearing round, horn spectacles, he resembled
in his fastidiousness of dress and deportment a
Pickwick in modern attire. At the moment his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>face, generally round and rosy with an ever present
smile, wore an unusual seriousness of expression
as he greeted Mrs. Hale and Richards. He
glanced inquiringly at Ferguson and returned
that official’s bow with a courteous inclination of
his head.</p>

<p>“Detective Ferguson has been waiting to see
you, John,” explained Mrs. Hale, as the men
stood for a second in silence.</p>

<p>Ferguson stepped forward. “You told me to
call at ten o’clock, Mr. Hale,” he reminded him,
and John nodded.</p>

<p>“So I did,” he acknowledged. “Sorry to have
kept you waiting, but I had to see the superintendent
of the cemetery,” he stopped and cleared
his voice. “Latimer and I have just returned
from making arrangements for the funeral services.
Have you,” again a slight huskiness in his
usually clear voice slurred his words, “have you
heard, Ferguson, the result of the autopsy?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Hale, but it was held&mdash;&mdash;” Ferguson
looked over his shoulder on hearing footsteps
behind him and saw Leonard McLane walk between
the portières of the folding doors, held back
by the attentive waitress, Anna.</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane,”&mdash;the detective gave no one an
opportunity to greet the busy surgeon&mdash;“you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>were present with Coroner Penfield at the post-mortem
examination of young Hale, were you
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” McLane took the hand Mrs. Hale
extended to him and gave it a reassuring squeeze;
he judged from her unaccustomed pallor that she
was much upset. “Yes, well?” and he looked
inquiringly at the detective.</p>

<p>“Tell us the result, doctor,” urged Ferguson,
and added as McLane hesitated, “You will be
betraying no confidences, because the coroner telephoned
me to stop and see him about it when I
leave here.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, McLane,” broke in John Hale.
“I am entitled to know what caused Austin’s
death&mdash;don’t keep me in suspense any longer,”
and McLane, looking at him closely, saw that tiny
beads of sweat had gathered on Hale’s forehead.</p>

<p>John Hale, who measured six feet two in his
stocking feet, presented a striking contrast to
Frank Latimer as they stood side by side, a contrast
Washington society had laughed at and
grown accustomed to. Their Damon and Pythias
friendship had commenced when they were students
at Harvard University and, continued
through the years of their separation when John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>Hale was in Mexico, was cemented again upon the
latter’s return to make his home permanently in
the National Capital. Hale was the elder by two
years. His healthy out-of-door life showed in
the breadth of his shoulders and deep chest, and he
was seldom credited with being forty-seven years
of age. For the first time McLane became aware
of the crow’s-feet discernible under his eyes as
John Hale moved nearer him.</p>

<p>“Coroner Penfield’s examination,” McLane
stated, “proved that Austin died as the result of
a wound in the chest. The weapon penetrated
the right ventricle of the heart, and death was
due to internal hemorrhage.”</p>

<p>A heavy sob broke from Mrs. Hale. “Oh,
poor Austin!” she lamented. “Oh, why did he
do so mad an act?”</p>

<p>“Explain your meaning, madam,” insisted
Ferguson quickly, and held up a cautioning hand
as John Hale was about to interrupt her.</p>

<p>“Why, kill himself,” asserted Mrs. Hale.
“To commit suicide <i>is</i> a mad act,” she added a
trifle defiantly and gazed at her silent companions.</p>

<p>“Was the wound self-inflicted, doctor?” questioned
Ferguson, and Mrs. Hale grew conscious
of the strained attention of her companions as
they waited in silence for McLane’s answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>The surgeon answered with a question.</p>

<p>“Was any weapon found by the body?”</p>

<p>Ferguson took from his pocket a package
wrapped in oilskin. Removing the wrapping, he
exhibited a pair of long slender shears. One
blade was covered with bloodstains.</p>

<p>“These shears were lying near the body,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“And under a rug,” Richards broke his long
silence. “I distinctly recall seeing you pick them
up, Ferguson, and remember the position they
were in when you found them.”</p>

<p>“They were not under a rug,” retorted Ferguson.
“The edge of the rug was turned back and
covered them. Don’t touch the steel, sir,”&mdash;as
Richards stepped to his side and studied the
shears&mdash;“I’ve had impressions made for possible
finger marks. You haven’t answered my question,
doctor; was it suicide?”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>“But not probably?” quickly.</p>

<p>“Have a care, Ferguson.” Richards spoke
with sternness. “Don’t impute a meaning to
Dr. McLane’s words; let him put his own construction
on them.” Abruptly he turned to the
surgeon. “Could the wound have been accidentally
inflicted?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>McLane stared at him. “I don’t quite catch
your meaning?”</p>

<p>“Could Austin have tripped or stumbled and
fallen on the shears?”</p>

<p>“He could have tripped or stumbled, certainly;
but if he had fallen on the shears both blades
would have penetrated his chest&mdash;” McLane
pointed to them. “Only one blade is bloodstained.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure they are bloodstains and not
rust?” As he put the question, Richards again
scrutinized the shears.</p>

<p>Ferguson smiled skeptically. “The stains have
already been subjected to chemical tests,” he said.
“It is human blood. Another thing, Major, if
Austin Hale fell on these shears and, improbable
as it may seem, was stabbed by only one blade,
that blade would have remained in the wound,
would it not, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then we can dismiss the theory of accidental
death,” argued Ferguson, “and there remain
homicide or suicide. Come, doctor, could Austin
have pulled out the shears’ blade after stabbing
himself?”</p>

<p>McLane shook his head dubiously. “Death
resulted almost instantaneously,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Richards, who had thrust his hands into his
trousers’ pockets, clenched them until the nails
dug into the flesh, while Detective Ferguson, with
a covert smile, rolled up the shears once again in
the piece of oilskin and replaced them in his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Suicide is then out of the question,” he commented
gravely. “It leaves us face to face with
homicide. What motive inspired Austin Hale’s
murder, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>A low moan escaped Mrs. Hale. “There
<i>could</i> be no motive,” she stammered. “Austin
had no enemies, and this was his home; he was
surrounded only with relatives&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And he was murdered,” Ferguson’s lips parted
in a dangerous smile, as he swung on John Hale.
“Come, sir, have you no facts to disclose, no
aid to offer in tracking down your son’s murder?”</p>

<p>John Hale regarded him for a moment in grim
silence.</p>

<p>“I give you a free hand to follow every clew,”
he affirmed, “and offer a reward of five thousand
dollars for the apprehension and conviction of
his murderer.”</p>

<p>Detective Ferguson buttoned his coat and
picked up his hat which he had brought with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>him into the drawing-room; then he turned to
McLane.</p>

<p>“Can I see your patient, Mr. Robert Hale?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Not now.” McLane addressed Mrs. Hale.
“I have given your husband a sedative,” he said.
“Keep all excitement from him when he awakens;
I will call later.”</p>

<p>“But see here, doctor,” objected Ferguson, “I
must interview Mr. Hale,” and in his earnestness
he laid a persuasive hand on the surgeon’s coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>“So you can, shortly,” answered McLane.
“Come with me, Ferguson, I’ll take you to the
coroner’s,” and there was that about McLane
which deterred the detective from pressing the
point. With a bow to the others McLane hurried
away, Ferguson in his wake. Mrs. Hale gazed
in dead silence at her three companions, then
found relief in tears.</p>

<p>“Hush, Agatha,” exclaimed her brother-in-law,
as her sobs grew in volume. “Calm yourself.”</p>

<p>John Hale’s strong voice carried some comfort,
and she looked up a few minutes later as the gong
over the front door rang loudly. Through her
tear-dimmed eyes she had a fleeting glimpse of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>familiar, slender figure hurrying past the portières
and through the central hall to the circular staircase.
Mrs. Hale’s tears burst out afresh.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “I just can’t break the
news of Austin’s death to Polly Davis&mdash;they
were engaged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are talking
about!” John Hale spoke with rough vehemence.
“Polly and Austin were not engaged,”
and turning on his heel he stamped his way out
of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale gazed in bewilderment at Richards
and Latimer; the former answered her unspoken
question.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you aware of the situation?” he
asked, and there was mockery in his tone. “John
Hale and Austin, his stepson, were both madly in
love with Polly&mdash;your husband’s secretary.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nna</span>, the waitress, took one more comprehensive
look around the prettily
furnished boudoir to make sure that she
had not overlooked the sugar bowl; it was certainly
nowhere in sight. Anna paused on her
way to the door leading to Judith’s bedroom,
turned back and, picking up the breakfast tray,
departed to her domain below stairs.</p>

<p>Judith, totally unaware that she had disturbed
her mother’s excellent waitress by walking off
in a moment of absent-mindedness with the sugar
bowl, saw reflected in her long cheval glass the
closing of the boudoir door, and crossing her bedroom,
made certain, by a peep inside, that Anna
had gone. With a quick turn of her wrist she
shut the door and locked it. The suite which she
and her husband occupied consisted of three
rooms, the boudoir, their bedroom, and beyond
that a large dressing room and bath. There was
but one entrance to the suite&mdash;by way of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>boudoir, which rendered their quarters absolutely
private.</p>

<p>Judith perched herself on one of the twin beds,
and, feeling underneath her pillow, pulled out a
gold locket from which dangled the broken link
of a gold chain. There was nothing extraordinary
in the appearance of the locket, nothing to
distinguish it from many other such ornaments,
yet it held Judith’s gaze with the power of a
snake-charmer. Twice she looked away from it,
twice dropped it under the folds of the tossed
back bedclothes, only to pick it up each time and
tip it this way and that in the pink palm of her
hand. Three times she crooked her fingers over
the spring, but the pressure needed to open the
locket was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Suddenly Judith raised her eyes and scanned
the bedroom&mdash;the glass-topped dressing table
with its tortoise-shell, gold-initialed toilet set; the
tall chiffonnier on which lay her husband’s military
hair brushes and a framed photograph of
Judith; the <i>chaise longue</i> with its numerous soft
pillows, the comfortable chairs&mdash;Judith passed
them over with scant attention, and gazed at the
pictures on the walls, the draperies over the bow
window and its broad seat, which added much to
the attractiveness of her room, and lastly at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>small leather box resembling a Kodak. The box
was perched precariously near the edge of the
mantel shelf. Judith walked over to it, jerked up
the clasps and lifted the lid. She pushed aside
the contents of the box and placed the locket underneath
several coils of wire, then closing the
box, set it behind the mantel clock. An inspection
of the dial showed her that the hour hand was
about to register ten o’clock.</p>

<p>The next moment Judith was seated before her
dressing table and unbraiding her hair. It
fell in a shower about her shoulders, the winter
sunshine picking out the hidden strains of gold
in its rich chestnut. A deep, deep sigh escaped
Judith as she stared at her reflection in the mirror.
It was a very lovely face that confronted
her, not one to call forth a sigh from the observer.
The delicately arched eyebrows, the tender,
sensitive mouth, the brilliancy of the deep
blue eyes&mdash;but enhanced by the shadows underneath
them,&mdash;the long lashes, and the small
shapely head all combined to win for Judith the
title of “belle” when introduced three years before
to Washington society.</p>

<p>Judith’s popularity had been a matter of unbounded
gratification to her mother, whose ambition
for a titled son-in-law was thereby encouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and dinned into her husband’s ears, to his
intense disgust, but in spite of his gruff reception
of her suggestions, Robert Hale had seen to it
that only the most eligible bachelors were invited
to their home. Judith had signally failed to encourage
any one of her many attentive cavaliers,
and when taken to task by her mother, had responded
that no man should be handicapped by a
deaf wife and that she did not intend to marry; a
statement which, in its quiet determination, had
staggered her mother.</p>

<p>Judith had thrown herself heart and soul into
war work, and though not accepted for service
overseas on account of her deafness, she had won,
through her efficiency and knowledge of languages,
a position in the Department of State
carrying great responsibilities, and she had retired
from it, after the Armistice, with the commendation
of the Department’s highest officials.</p>

<p>The hard work, the long hours, and the close
confinement indoors to one accustomed, as Judith
had been, to a life in the open, had resulted in a
nervous collapse, and Doctor McLane, their family
physician, had advised a complete change of
environment. The medical dictum had come on
the heels of a letter from the United States
Consul at Tokio and his wife, asking Judith to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>make them a long promised visit, and within
forty-eight hours all details of her trip across the
continent with friends returning to their home in
San Francisco after two years’ war work in
Washington, had been arranged, and a cable was
sent to Mr. and Mrs. Noyes in Tokio, notifying
them to expect Judith on the next steamer.</p>

<p>And in Tokio, two weeks after her arrival,
Judith had met Joseph Richards, major of the
&mdash;th Regiment, invalided home from arduous
service in Siberia with the A. E. F., and bearing
on his broad breast ribbons denoting Russian,
Japanese, and British decorations awarded for
valor.</p>

<p>Richards had received a warm welcome in the
Noyes’ home, and his hostess, a born matchmaker,
was quick to observe his infatuation for Judith,
and did everything within her power to aid his
courtship.</p>

<p>Judith strove to steel her heart to his ardent
pleading, but all to no purpose&mdash;youth called to
youth in a language familiar to every age, and in
the romantic background of the Land of the
Chrysanthemum they pledged their troth. A
week later they were married in the American
Consulate by a United States Navy chaplain, and
Mr. and Mrs. Noyes, looking backward over their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>own well-ordered wedded life, wished them Godspeed
on their road to happiness.</p>

<p>Happy days had followed, happier than any
Judith had known, for in spite of her brave attempt
to ignore her deafness and to show only a
contented front to the world, that very deafness
had built a barrier of reserve which even Judith’s
parents had never penetrated. But Richards,
whose deep love was a guide to a sympathetic
understanding of her shy and sensitive nature,
gained a devotion almost akin to worship as the
days sped on, and then came the summons home.</p>

<p>With a faint shiver Judith straightened herself
in her chair, put down her hair brush and took up
the slender wire (in shape like those worn by
telephone operators, but much lighter and narrower)
attached to the earpiece of the “globia-phone,”
and slipped it over her head. It took
but a second to adjust the earpiece, and with deft
fingers she dressed her hair low on her neck and
covering her ears. The style was not only extremely
becoming, but completely hid the little
instrument held so snugly against her ear. It
took but a moment to complete her dressing, and
slipping the small battery of the “globia-phone”
inside her belt, she adjusted the lace jabot so that
its soft folds concealed but did not obscure the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>sound-gathering part of the earphone, and with
one final look in the glass to make sure that her
becoming costume fitted perfectly, she turned
away just as a loud knock sounded on the boudoir
door. Judith laid her hand involuntarily on the
back of her chair, then, squaring her shoulders,
she walked across the room and unlocked the door
and faced her father’s secretary.</p>

<p>“Polly!” The ejaculation was low-spoken
and Judith cast one searching look about the boudoir
before pulling the girl inside her bedroom
and closing the door. “Have you just come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I came right up here.” Polly Davis,
conscious that her knees were treacherously weak,
sank into the nearest chair, and Judith, in the uncompromising
glare of the morning sunlight, saw
in the girl’s upturned face the haggard lines which
care had brought overnight. Judith dropped on
her knees beside Polly and threw her arm protectingly
about her. They had been classmates
at a fashionable private school until the death of
Polly’s father had brought retrenchment and,
later, painful economies in its wake, so that she
was obliged to forsake her lessons for a clerkship.</p>

<p>The change from affluence to poverty had produced
no alteration in the affection the two girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>bore each other, an affection on Judith’s part tempered
with responsibility, as Polly, her junior by
a few months, came frequently to her for advice&mdash;which
she seldom if ever followed. Polly’s
contact with the world had borne fruit in an embittered
outlook on life which in some degree
alienated her from her former friends, and she
had turned to Judith with the heart-hunger of a
nature thrown upon itself for woman’s companionship.
Polly’s dainty blond beauty and bright
vivacity had gained her lasting popularity with
men, but with her own sex she was generally
classed as “catty.”</p>

<p>Judith was the first to speak. “Polly&mdash;what
can I say?” she stammered. “How comfort
you?”</p>

<p>For answer the yellow head was dropped on
Judith’s shoulder and dry, tearless sobs racked
her slender body.</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush!” exclaimed Judith, alarmed
by her agony. “Polly, Polly, remember&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Remember!” Polly sat up as if stabbed.
“Oh, if I could only forget!” A violent shudder
shook her. Regaining her composure by degrees,
she finally straightened up. “There, the
storm is over,” and she dashed her hand across
her eyes. “Never allude to this again&mdash;promise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
me.” She spoke with vehemence, and Judith
laid a quieting hand on hers.</p>

<p>“I give you my word never to speak of the
subject,” she pledged.</p>

<p>“Not even to your husband?”</p>

<p>“No, not even to Joe.” Her answer, although
prompt, held a note of reluctance.</p>

<p>Polly’s smile was twisted. Opening her vanity
box, she inspected her face in its tiny mirror. A
faint shriek escaped her.</p>

<p>“I’m a fright!” she ejaculated, and rising,
went over to Judith’s dressing table and proceeded
to powder her nose. Drawing out a box of
rouge, Polly applied some of it to her cheeks.
“There, that’s better.” She turned briskly and
looked at Judith. “Do you think your father
will discover it is not natural bloom?” she asked
flippantly.</p>

<p>Judith’s answer was a stare; Polly’s transition
from grief to pert nonchalance was startling.</p>

<p>“Father is not very well,” she replied slowly.
“Joe went to inquire for him just before breakfast
was announced, and Mother said he was
asleep and could not be disturbed.”</p>

<p>Polly contemplated herself in the mirror. “I
am sorry,” she remarked, but her tone was perfunctory
and a brief silence followed. “Gracious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it is nearly eleven o’clock. Judith, I must
fly; for your father left a pile of correspondence
in the den&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait, Polly.” Judith, who had followed her
across the bedroom, laid her hand against the
door. “There is a question you must answer.
Were you&mdash;did you,” she stumbled in her
speech, “did you know that Austin was to return
here last night?”</p>

<p>The rouge on Polly’s cheeks showed up plainly
against the dead whiteness of her skin.</p>

<p>“I fail to see what business it is of yours
if I knew or did not know of Austin’s contemplated
return,” she replied, and before Judith
guessed her intention she had slipped under her
arm and bolted through the boudoir into the hall,
leaving Judith staring after her.</p>

<p>The thick carpet deadened Polly’s flying footsteps
as she hurried to the den, a room set aside
for Robert Hale’s exclusive use. It adjoined his
bedroom, and there the scientist spent many hours
going carefully over his manuscripts and statistical
research work. It was in one sense a labor
of love for, thanks to the timely death of a relative,
he had inherited a large estate which brought
in its train a handsome income; he was, therefore,
not dependent upon a salaried position and could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>indulge his whims and vagaries. And these same
whims and vagaries had, mingled with an unbridled
temper, made the post of secretary to the
eminent scientist no sinecure. Polly Davis had
secured the position through Judith’s influence,
and she had remained longer than the majority
of her predecessors, a fact which had won sarcastic
comments from Robert Hale and&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>Polly paused on reaching the middle of the den
and stared at the man seated with his back to
her, bending over Robert Hale’s flat-topped desk.
With infinite care he went over paper after paper,
and as he lifted his hands Polly saw that he was
wearing rubber gloves. With the instinct which
seems to warn of another’s presence, he partly
turned in his chair and gazed at the motionless
figure behind him. A constrained silence followed,
which John Hale was the first to break.</p>

<p>“Why did you not go to Baltimore?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Her reply was slow in coming.</p>

<p>“I have altered my plans,” she stated, and,
crossing to her own desk, she dropped into the
revolving chair standing before it.</p>

<p>John Hale watched her for an instant, and not
a detail of her appearance escaped him. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>was an ominous tightening of his lips, and he
lowered his gaze that she might not read its telltale
message. Without further comment he removed
his gloves, rolled them into a ball and
stuffed them in his pocket. In the lengthening
silence Polly’s eyes strayed to a pile of papers and
she swung the typewriter on its iron supporting-frame,
which was attached to her desk, toward
her.</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I go on with my work.” Her
voice was cold and formal. Slowly John Hale
rose to his feet, and the bigness of the man filled
the small room. Polly looked only at her typewriter.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I detained you.” His voice
matched hers in tone and quality.</p>

<p>Polly raised her eyes and contemplated him.
“Did you find what you were looking for in
your brother’s desk, Mr. Hale?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Hale’s answer was indirect. “Mr. Hale,” he
repeated. “Why not&mdash;John?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The finality of the monosyllable brought an
angry flush to John Hale’s bronzed cheeks, and
without another word he swung on his heel, only
to pause at the door and again address her.</p>

<p>“Austin’s funeral will take place to-morrow,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>he announced, and the next second he was gone.</p>

<p>Many minutes passed before Polly moved, then
rising, she walked over to Robert Hale’s desk and
went feverishly through his drawers, one question
uppermost in her mind&mdash;what had John Hale
been looking for? She had about completed her
self-imposed task when a voice over her shoulder
caused her to catch her breath.</p>

<p>“Why are you searching among my husband’s
papers?” asked Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p>Polly swung around in Robert Hale’s comfortable
chair.</p>

<p>“How you startled me!” she confessed, with
a faint tinkling laugh, a laugh which had irritated
Mrs. Hale in the past. “Dear Mrs. Hale, how
noiselessly you move.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” tartly.</p>

<p>“I never heard you enter the room.” Polly
moved back to her own desk. “Your husband
must find you a perfect treasure when you are attending
him during his illness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale flushed and promptly forgot to utter
the sympathetic platitudes she had prepared when
on her way to find Polly. Austin Hale ever engaged
to such a chit of a girl? The idea was
unbelievable. And John, her staid, solemn
brother-in-law, in love with her! Mrs. Hale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>snorted. Joe Richards should be given a piece
of her mind for putting such ideas in her head;
she would even speak to Judith about it.</p>

<p>“Why were you going through my husband’s
papers?” she asked, and her manner in putting
the question was anything but agreeable. “I insist
upon an answer.”</p>

<p>Polly’s eyes opened innocently. “Surely, Mrs.
Hale, the matter is not secret. I was looking for
a memorandum which your husband left for me.
It was about so square,”&mdash;demonstrating with
her fingers,&mdash;“on yellowish paper.”</p>

<p>Polly, when moving her hands, dislodged a
package of papers and they fell to the floor. In
stooping to pick them up, she missed seeing Mrs.
Hale’s quick start and sudden change of color.
When she raised her head, she found Mrs. Hale’s
cold blue eyes were regarding her with disconcerting
intensity.</p>

<p>“Was John in here a moment ago?” she asked,
and Polly was conscious of flushing hotly; the
question was unexpected.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see him leave, Mrs. Hale?” she
asked sweetly, and this time it was Mrs. Hale who
flushed. There were occasions when she actively
disliked her husband’s accomplished secretary.</p>

<p>“I met him in the hall,” she explained coldly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>“But I was not sure whether he had just left
here or my husband’s bedroom. Please remember,
Polly, that Mr. Hale is ill and that the sound
of your typewriter carries into the next room.”</p>

<p>“In that case”&mdash;Polly drew her chair closer
to her desk with a businesslike air and picked up
her pen&mdash;“I will write answers in long hand to
these business communications, unless you wish
something further”&mdash;and she waited in polite
expectancy.</p>

<p>“I want nothing”&mdash;Mrs. Hale drew herself
up. “Kindly make as little noise as possible,
Polly. Above all, don’t let that telephone ring,”
pointing to the instrument which stood almost at
the girl’s elbow.</p>

<p>“I shall be as quiet as possible,” Polly promised,
and Mrs. Hale, satisfied that she had made
Polly understand that she was capable of issuing
orders in her husband’s absence, walked toward
the hall door. Polly’s voice halted her as she
was on the point of leaving the room.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Hale very ill?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” Mrs. Hale spoke with positiveness.
“But Dr. McLane said that he was under
the effects of a sedative. I was in our bedroom
a moment ago and Robert was sound asleep.
Polly,”&mdash;she hesitated and fingered her hand bag&mdash;“if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
you come across a memorandum bearing
my name, be <i>sure</i> to let me see it,” and with a
whisk of her skirts she hastened away.</p>

<p>Polly stared at the highly glazed surface of
Robert Hale’s expensive stationery and then at
her penholder. Suddenly she pitched the latter
from her and, rising, methodically searched the
entire room, taking care that her movements made
no noise.</p>

<p>In his comfortable four-post bed in the darkened
room adjoining his den, Robert Hale smiled
to himself as he dragged the eider-down quilt up
about his ears and lay still. His daughter Judith
had not inherited his acute hearing.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ain</span> and snow followed by sleet had
reduced the traffic in the streets of the
Capital City to venturesome taxicabs
and occasional delivery cars. Few Washingtonians,
not required by necessity to venture out of
doors, were so unwise as to risk a fall on the
slippery pavements, and the generally gay thoroughfares
of the fashionable Northwest were deserted.
Weather-forecasters had announced in
the morning press that a decade had passed since
such a combination of ice and sleet had visited
the city so late in the winter.</p>

<p>The small procession of automobiles returning
from Oak Hill Cemetery coasted its way with
care down the steep hills of Georgetown and along
the ice-covered asphalt. John Hale, the occupant
of the foremost car, pulled out his handkerchief
and mopped his face, which, in spite of the biting
north wind and the zero weather, was damp with
perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Thank God!” he muttered rather than spoke.
“That is over.” He turned and scowled at his
companion. “Well, Frank, haven’t you anything
to say?”</p>

<p>Frank Latimer, who had been studying his
friend in silence, roused himself.</p>

<p>“It was a trying ordeal,” he remarked gravely,
“and like you, I am relieved that the funeral is
over. Poor Austin!”</p>

<p>John Hale winced. “Don’t!” he exclaimed.
“Suppose we leave the&mdash;the laments to my sister-in-law,
Agatha.”</p>

<p>Latimer nodded sympathetically. “She made
an exhibition of herself in the chapel,” he acknowledged.
“I had no idea that she was so
attached to Austin. In fact,”&mdash;Latimer lowered
his voice to confidential tones&mdash;“I’ve always understood
that she opposed a marriage between
Judith and Austin.”</p>

<p>“And quite rightly,” Hale’s voice rang out
sharply. “Judith is a splendid type of young
womanhood, while&mdash;&mdash;” He checked his impetuous speech.
“I opposed the match, also.”</p>

<p>“So I recall.” Latimer offered his cigarette
case to his friend. His chubby face wore a
troubled expression. “Agatha Hale is a bit of a
trial, old man; let’s forget her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“I wish I could,” with gloomy fervor. “Why
Robert ever picked out such a piece of contrariness
I never could understand; one moment your
friend, the next against you&mdash;and emotional!”
His tone spoke volumes. “While Robert&mdash;&mdash;”
He smiled wryly and Latimer finished the sentence.</p>

<p>“Is the most unemotional of men,” he agreed.
“Judith is more like you, John, than like either
of her parents.”</p>

<p>Hale moved uneasily and changed the conversation
with some abruptness as the car drove up
to the curb and stopped before his brother’s residence.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you, Frank, for bringing
me home,” he said, preparing to spring out as
the chauffeur opened the door. “I don’t think I
could have stood driving back in the same car with
Agatha and Judith. Won’t you come in with
me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, thanks; I have an appointment,” Latimer
responded. “I’ll see you later perhaps at
the club. Eh, what the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The ejaculation was wrung from him by John
Hale’s sudden clutch on his arm and before he
quite realized what was happening he found himself
propelled out of the car. Once on the sidewalk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the little stockbroker turned to his big companion
in wrathful bewilderment. The explanation
John Hale offered for his precipitous action
was given under his breath, and Jackson, the
chauffeur, failed to hear it as he climbed back in
his seat and, obedient to a signal from his employer,
shut off his engine.</p>

<p>“That damn bounder from Police Headquarters
is waiting for an interview, Frank.” John
Hale indicated one of the library windows overlooking
the street where Latimer saw a man peering
out from behind the curtains. “I had entirely
forgotten that Detective Ferguson telephoned
and asked me to see him this afternoon.
I want you to be present.”</p>

<p>The urgency of his tone silenced Latimer’s
objections, and without a word he accompanied
him into the house, Anna, the waitress, holding
the front door hospitably open for them. Almost
tossing his fur-lined overcoat and hat into
the servant’s arms, John Hale strode at once into
the library, and Latimer, pausing only long
enough to put down his hat and cane on the hall
table, followed him, forgetting in his interest that
he had not removed his overcoat.</p>

<p>At the sound of their footsteps Detective
Ferguson stepped away from the window-alcove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>where he had been a witness of their arrival.
John Hale’s curt greeting and Latimer’s short
nod caused him to redden; he was not accustomed
to such outward display of contempt, for so he
interpreted their manner.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Ferguson?” asked
John Hale, signing to the detective to draw up
a chair as he threw himself down on a lounge.
“Sit down, Frank,” and he turned again to the
detective, as the latter remained silent, with an
impatient “Well?”</p>

<p>“You can answer a few questions, sir,” replied
Ferguson.</p>

<p>John Hale lifted his broad shoulders in a contemptuous
shrug.</p>

<p>“I have already shown great patience in that
line,” he remarked dryly.</p>

<p>“Pardon me; you have answered a few questions
most impatiently,” retorted Ferguson. His
temper was rising and rapidly overcoming discretion.
Instead of an angry rejoinder, John
Hale gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, go on, what are your questions?” he
asked. “Remember that we have just come from
my stepson’s funeral, and,”&mdash;he cleared his
throat before continuing&mdash;“I&mdash;have been under
a severe strain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“True, sir; I promise not to be long.” Ferguson
hitched his chair nearer the two men. “It is
in regard to the funeral that I desire to speak.
I was told by Coroner Penfield that you had requested
that Austin Hale’s body be cremated.”</p>

<p>“Well?” questioned John Hale as Ferguson
paused.</p>

<p>“Why did you make that request, Mr. Hale?”</p>

<p>“Because I believe in cremation,” promptly.</p>

<p>“Were you not aware that Austin’s body could
not be cremated until after the mystery of his
murder had been solved?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“One does not have to be a lawyer to know
that such a request would be refused,” replied
Ferguson.</p>

<p>Again John Hale shrugged his shoulders.
“The request was perfectly reasonable,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Under normal conditions, yes,” dryly.
“Why did you make it?”</p>

<p>John Hale’s raised eyebrows indicated annoyance
at the detective’s persistence. “I have already
told you,” he stated. “It is hardly necessary
to repeat that I believe in cremation.”</p>

<p>“And the absolute destruction of the body, so
that no further medical examination could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>made if the need arose?” Ferguson smiled skeptically.
“Now, honestly, did you really think
such a request would get by?”</p>

<p>John Hale controlled his temper with an effort.
“An autopsy had already been held and the cause
of Austin’s death determined,” he pointed out,
and then, addressing his silent companion,
“What was McLane’s exact definition, Frank?”</p>

<p>Latimer took out his notebook and turned its
pages until he came to an entry.</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane stated that Austin died as the
result of a chest wound, and that death was instantaneous,
as the weapon penetrated to the
heart, or words to that effect,” he added and replaced
the notebook in his pocket, as John Hale
again addressed the detective.</p>

<p>“You see, Ferguson, the autopsy told the cause
of death; therefore my request was not only
natural, believing, as I do, in cremation, but
reasonable.” He leaned back and regarded the
detective with candid eyes. “That it was not
granted was the unreasonable feature of the
case.”</p>

<p>Ferguson was slow in replying. “That you
were advised to have the body placed in the receiving
vault at the cemetery shows how your request
was regarded by the authorities, Mr. Hale,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>he remarked, and Latimer broke into the discussion.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” he remonstrated. “You go
too far in your zeal, Ferguson. The ground is
hard frozen and no graves can be dug; therefore
all bodies are being placed in the receiving vaults
until the weather moderates.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” Ferguson’s smile was non-committal.
“But&mdash;your request came very pat,
Mr. Hale, and&mdash;it didn’t make a hit with Headquarters.”</p>

<p>John Hale straightened his powerful figure.
“I don’t care a damn how it hit Headquarters!”
he declared, and his voice rose in angry accents.
“If this is all you wish with me, we may as well
cut short our interview; my time is valuable.”</p>

<p>“And so is mine, sir,” retorted Ferguson with
equal heat. “How much longer am I going to
be prevented from seeing your brother, Mr. Robert
Hale?”</p>

<p>“Depends on how long it takes you to turn
your head,” remarked a voice back of the three
men, and with one accord they spun around.
Robert Hale was occupying his favorite chair and
he met their stares with one of mild surprise.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in the room?” demanded
John Hale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>His brother looked at the clock on the mantel.
“A bare thirty seconds,” he answered. “You
were so absorbed in conversation that I hesitated
to interrupt you. When this gentleman”&mdash;with
a motion of his hand toward Ferguson&mdash;“asked
in such impassioned tones for a sight of me, I
could not refrain from announcing my presence.”</p>

<p>“But”&mdash;John Hale bent forward and stared
earnestly at his brother&mdash;“Dr. McLane said that
you were to remain in bed, that you were too
weak&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hale interrupted him with a snap of his fingers.
“That for McLane’s diagnosis,” he said.
“I am a bit weak, but staying in bed won’t cure
that complaint, so I dressed myself and came
downstairs. Where is Agatha?”</p>

<p>“She’s out,” tersely.</p>

<p>“So Anna informed me when I met her in the
hall.” Hale swung his chair around to the left
so as to face them more directly. “Anna also
said that Judith was out and that Polly Davis was
not in the house? Why is every one out?
Why”&mdash;with a quick impatient gesture&mdash;“is
there such a funereal air about the house?”</p>

<p>John Hale groaned inwardly and wasted a bitter
ejaculation on his sister-in-law. Why had
Agatha postponed telling her husband of Austin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
death? What if McLane had advised keeping
the tragic news from him&mdash;if he was strong
enough to dress himself unassisted and walk about
the house, he had been strong enough to be told
of the events of the past forty-eight hours. But
it had now fallen to his lot to do so&mdash;it was
generally his lot to be the harbinger of bad news
in the family. John Hale’s mouth set in grim
lines.</p>

<p>“There has been a funeral in the house,” he announced
with characteristic bluntness. “Austin
died Tuesday night.”</p>

<p>“Austin!” Hale sat bolt upright and regarded
his brother; suddenly he sank back in his
chair and his head sagged forward on his chest.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” John Hale leaped to his feet
but Latimer was before him in reaching his
brother’s side.</p>

<p>“Some water&mdash;wine!” he called, and Ferguson
bolted from the room in search of Anna, the
waitress. He found her polishing silver in the
dining room and at his breathless request she
filled a glass with ice water and thrust it in his
hand. Ferguson reached the library just as Latimer
forced some cognac between Hale’s bloodless
lips.</p>

<p>“He will revive in a minute,” he said, laying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>down the flask which John Hale, recovering his
dazed wits, had taken from a cabinet in one corner
of the library where his brother kept some
wine secreted. “His pulse is better now&mdash;there,”
as the powerful stimulant took effect.
“He is coming to. Here, take a sip of this,”
and Latimer snatched the glass of water out of
Ferguson’s hand. Hale, his eyelids fluttering,
drank slowly as Latimer tilted the glass gently
against his lips.</p>

<p>With an effort Hale jerked himself erect and
then leaned back, pushing aside, as he did so,
Latimer’s supporting hand.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he protested weakly. “Just
over-estimated my strength&mdash;wait.”</p>

<p>In the ensuing silence Detective Ferguson
studied Robert Hale attentively; it was the first
time he had seen the scientist at close quarters.
There was something effeminate in Hale’s good
looks and, in spite of his gray hair, Ferguson put
him down in his estimation as belonging to the
“pretty boy type.” The impression was enhanced
by the stalwart appearance of John Hale;
the brothers were in striking contrast, both in
physical build and in mental equipment&mdash;one had
achieved fame in his chosen profession, while the
other had made a bare living as the result of hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>work. Ferguson’s lips curled in contempt; the
small, slight, middle-aged man was hardly an impressive
figure.</p>

<p>Suddenly Robert Hale reached for the flask and
Latimer gave it to him. Tilting his head
backward, Hale took a long swallow, then
laid the flask carefully on the table within easy
reach.</p>

<p>“Now, John,” he began, “tell me of Austin.”</p>

<p>“I should have broken the news more gently,”
John Hale spoke with contrition. “I should
have remembered that you and Austin were great
pals.”</p>

<p>His brother passed his hand across his lips.
“We were&mdash;” He paused abruptly and did
not complete his sentence. “Come, don’t be
afraid, I have myself in hand; tell me the details.”</p>

<p>John Hale looked dubiously at Latimer and the
latter nodded his encouragement. “Go ahead,
tell him the whole story,” he advised. “It’s
worse to keep him in suspense.”</p>

<p>“Austin died on Tuesday night,” John Hale
stated, choosing his words with care, “to be exact,
some time on Wednesday morning. He was
stabbed to death.”</p>

<p>“Stabbed!” Hale’s hand stole toward the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>flask, then was withdrawn. “Stabbed by
whom?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Robert Hale’s color was returning
slowly. “Where was Austin murdered?”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>“Here?” The repetition was parrotlike.</p>

<p>“Yes, here.” Ferguson took a step forward
and for the first time joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>Hale turned and regarded him in silence, then
looked inquiringly at Latimer.</p>

<p>“This is Detective Ferguson of the Central
Office,” he explained. “He is detailed to investigate
the mystery surrounding Austin’s death.”</p>

<p>Hale placed his elbow on the table and leaned
his head on his hand.</p>

<p>“And what have you discovered, Inspector?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing.” Ferguson, flattered by the title,
spoke with courteous promptness. “I have been
waiting to interview you, Mr. Hale, as to what
transpired here on Tuesday night.”</p>

<p>“Tuesday?” Hale reflected a moment.
“Let me see, I was taken ill with the ‘flu’ last
Friday, and I have not been up and about until
this morning. You will have to ask others in
my household for information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“I have,” Ferguson made no effort to conceal
his disappointment over his failure to elicit news.
“And every one declares nothing out of the ordinary
was either heard or seen.”</p>

<p>“Tuesday night,” repeated Robert Hale
thoughtfully. “Tuesday night&mdash;why, John,
you went in my stead with Agatha to the French
Embassy reception; did Judith accompany you?”</p>

<p>“No, she stayed at home,” John Hale explained.
“She said she had a headache.”</p>

<p>“And her husband?” inquired his brother.</p>

<p>“Major Richards? Oh, he had a business engagement
at the club.” John Hale pulled forward
a chair and sat down, the interview threatened
to grow protracted. “It was Joe who found
Austin on his return.”</p>

<p>“Joe found him!” Robert Hale glanced upward
and Latimer started at the sudden flash in
his dark eyes&mdash;eyes which until that moment
had seemed dull, almost dead, in their lusterless
expression. “Well, what then?”</p>

<p>“Joe called in the police,” John Hale continued.
“And to-day we are no nearer detecting
the criminal or discovering the motive for the
crime than we were at that hour.”</p>

<p>“Give us a chance, Mr. Hale,” protested
Ferguson. “This is the first time I’ve seen you,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>turning to the elder brother. “There’s some information
you must give, if Mr. John Hale
won’t.”</p>

<p>“Play fair, Ferguson,” objected John Hale.
“I have never refused&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, John.” Robert Hale spoke with
authority. “As the head of the house I will attend
to this investigation.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a slight scream from the
hall. The next instant the portières were pulled
aside and Mrs. Hale hurried toward him.</p>

<p>“Robert, you are really downstairs&mdash;and
Anna did not lie,” she commenced incoherently.
“Do you not know that you are jeopardizing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quiet, Agatha”&mdash;Robert Hale let his wife
clasp his hand in both of hers, and Detective
Ferguson, watching the scene with interest, was
again impressed with the quality of his voice.
Rich in tone, softly modulated, it almost caressed
the ear, and Hale’s faultless pronunciation added
to the soothing effect. “Where is Judith?”</p>

<p>“Taking off her wraps. She will be here
shortly.” Mrs. Hale seldom completed her sentences
when excited. “We have just returned
from&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I can guess”&mdash;Hale eyed her mourning and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>her reddened eyelids. “John has told me of Austin’s
death.” He patted her hand gently, sympathetically;
then before she could speak, addressed
the detective. “You said you wished to question
me; kindly do so.”</p>

<p>Ferguson pushed forward a chair for Mrs.
Hale near her husband and, drawing out his notebook,
chose a seat near the table.</p>

<p>“When did you last see Austin Hale?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Before he left for New York six weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Did you expect him to return on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was Austin in financial difficulties?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge.” Robert Hale
addressed his brother. “How about it,
John?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of his having financial difficulties,”
the latter replied, his attention partly diverted
by Mrs. Hale; she had an annoying habit
of biting her nails whenever perturbed in mind,
and the gnawing sound, slight as it was, was getting
on her brother-in-law’s nerves. She met his
glare with a fixed stare, totally unconscious of the
cause of his wrath.</p>

<p>“Was Austin in love?” inquired Ferguson, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>fountain pen flying over the paper, jotting down
questions and answers.</p>

<p>Robert Hale laughed faintly. “Does a kitten
play?” he asked. “John, you are better qualified
to answer that question than I; Austin was
your”&mdash;he paused&mdash;“stepson.”</p>

<p>“And my adopted son, as well,” John Hale
amplified his brother’s statement. “If Austin
intended to marry, I was not his confidant, and,
therefore, am unable”&mdash;his manner grew stiff
and formal&mdash;“to give you any information on
the subject.”</p>

<p>Ferguson frowned in perplexity. The antagonism
between the brothers was plainly discernible
and Frank Latimer, instinctively aware of
which way the detective’s thoughts were turning,
grew uncomfortably warm and conscious that he
was still wearing his heavy overcoat.</p>

<p>Had Ferguson learned of the frequent disputes
between the brothers, which had at different
times kept their Washington friends in constant
dread of their quarrels developing into actual
conflict?</p>

<p>“Is it your custom to keep your safe unlocked,
Mr. Hale?” asked Ferguson, breaking
the short silence.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Are you aware that it was open on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>Hale picked up the flask of cognac, eyed it a
moment, then laid it down again before answering.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Has any one besides you the combination?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The detective watched Hale closely. Was his
use of monosyllables due to physical weakness,
to a naturally taciturn disposition, or to a desire
to conceal information? Ferguson sighed impatiently
and resumed his examination with the
point still undecided in his mind.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hale,”&mdash;he spoke with growing impressiveness&mdash;“I
found Austin Hale lying dead in
this room on Wednesday morning&mdash;he was lying
within a few feet of your open safe. The door
had not been forced; therefore it must have been
opened by some one having the combination.”
He paused and the silence lengthened; abruptly
he broke it. “Please examine your safe, Mr.
Hale, and see if any money or documents are
missing.”</p>

<p>“Wait, Robert.” The caution came from
Mrs. Hale, and her husband looked at her with
marked displeasure. For the moment he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>forgotten her presence. “You must not overexert
yourself,” she continued. “Let me look in
the safe?”</p>

<p>Robert Hale was on his feet before she had finished
speaking.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me,” he exclaimed tartly.
“I know what I am about, Agatha,” and he
walked somewhat unsteadily over to the safe, the
others following until they grouped themselves
about him as he knelt down. There was a distinct
pause as he fumbled with the dial.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale’s anxiety grew&mdash;would her husband
never get the door open? She was again about to
intercede as she noted the paleness of his face
and his heavy breathing, but the door suddenly
swung open and the remonstrance remained unspoken.</p>

<p>Pushing his heavy gray hair off his forehead,
Hale moved closer to the safe, and without haste
examined every compartment, then, supported by
his attentive wife, he rose painfully to his feet
and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“My papers and my wife’s jewelry are intact,”
he stated.</p>

<p>Ferguson replaced his fountain pen and memorandum
pad in his pocket.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he declared. “Robbery was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>not the motive. The murder of Austin Hale was
an inside job&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” John Hale’s voice rang out
loudly and echoed through the large room.
“Robbery was the motive.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Ferguson’s eyes snapped with excitement.
Was he to learn something tangible at
last. “What was stolen?”</p>

<p>“Austin owned a valuable antique watch.”
John Hale spoke slowly, impressively, checking
off each word on his finger. “He always carried
it&mdash;it was almost a fetish with him. The watch
is missing.”</p>

<p>Concealed by the portières, Judith Richards
leaned limply against the door-jamb of the library
and only Anna, the waitress, passing through the
hall, heard her astounded gasp, followed by a low
moan.</p>

<span class="smaller">SPECULATION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was lacking twenty minutes of noon and
Polly Davis frowned discontentedly as she
consulted her wrist-watch. She was under
positive instructions from Robert Hale to complete
the compilation of data given to her the week
before. Hale’s cramped and peculiar style of
penmanship was difficult to read at any time, and
with her thoughts wandering far afield, Polly
found her task more irksome than usual.</p>

<p>Swiftly her fingers moved over the familiar
typewriter keys and with mechanical exactness
she copied&mdash;copied, pausing now and then to
decipher a nearly unintelligible paragraph, until
she came to the end of the manuscript notes. But
her sigh of relief changed to a swift, disgusted
ejaculation as, dragging the last sheet out of the
typewriter she discovered that she had carelessly
reversed the carbon and that the second copy,
intended for Hale’s files, was blank. The impression,
which should have been on it, was
stamped, instead, on the back of the top sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>With a gesture of rage she crumpled the sheet
in her hand and hurled it into the scrap basket.
In its flight the paper ball just missed striking
Anna, the waitress, whose noiseless entry a second
before had escaped her attention. At sight of
the servant Polly lowered her hand, still raised
after flinging the paper ball, and her features
relaxed to their wonted expression.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to bombard you, Anna,” she
apologized. “Would you mind moving the scrap
basket over here where it will be more handy?
Thanks,” as the servant complied with her request.
“Any letters for Mr. Hale?”</p>

<p>“The postman hasn’t brought the second mail
yet, Miss Polly.” Anna unfolded a small card
table and stood it in front of Polly. “I hope you
don’t mind having your luncheon a little earlier
to-day, miss. The Madam gave me this afternoon
off to go to the movies.”</p>

<p>“Mind? Well, hardly, I’m ravenous,” and
Polly brightened as Anna put a well-laden tray
before her. “You are quite a movie fan, Anna;
what are you going to see to-day?”</p>

<p>“‘The Official Chaperon.’” Anna poured out
a steaming cup of tea and deftly supplied the proper
amount of cream and sugar. “They say it
is a thriller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“The title is a little more sedate than ‘Without
Sin,’” acknowledged Polly laughing. “I believe
that was the last movie you told me of seeing;
perhaps the new one won’t give you a nightmare.”</p>

<p>Anna colored. She was sensitive about the
scene she had created ten days before when her
screams had awakened the household from sound
slumber and brought forth a severe scolding from
Mrs. Hale on the subject of attending trashy
plays. Robert Hale had interfered in time to
prevent Anna, whose red hair was indicative of
her hasty temper, from giving notice, to the relief
of the other members of the family who liked
the silent, well-trained servant.</p>

<p>“‘The Official Chaperon’ is a dandy,” she declared
stoutly. “’Least so the papers say. It’s
about a society girl who is under the hypnotic influence
of a rascal, miss, a regular rascal&mdash;he
even makes her commit murder.”</p>

<p>Anna brought out the last word with such intensity
that Polly actually jumped.</p>

<p>“I see you are in for another nightmare,” she
said, but the smile accompanying her banter was
fleeting. “Isn’t Mr. Austin’s murder terrible
enough without harrowing your soul with further
tragedies?”</p>

<p>Before replying Anna removed the cover of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>the toast dish and placed its tempting contents almost
directly under Polly’s nose.</p>

<p>“It’s terrible, miss; so terrible that I want to
forget it.”</p>

<p>Polly’s laugh did not ring quite true. “You
take an odd way to do so,” she remarked.
“However, Anna, go and see the hypnotic movie
murder, and my blessings go with you.”</p>

<p>Anna regarded the tray critically for an instant
without moving. “You are not eating,
miss,” she remonstrated. “I don’t know what
I’ll do with you and Miss Judith.”</p>

<p>Polly laid down her fork. She had been
merely toying with the salad on the plate before
her.</p>

<p>“Has Miss Judith lost her appetite?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss.” Anna stepped nearer and spoke
more rapidly. “Miss Judith appears sort of&mdash;of
in a trance, like.”</p>

<p>“Trance!” Anna had no occasion to complain
of inattention. Polly was regarding the
girl’s comely face with deep interest. For the
first time she observed the dark lines under the
large eyes and saw that the soft cream-tint of
Anna’s perfect complexion, which she had frequently
envied in the past, was an unhealthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>white. “Trance,” she repeated. “What do you
mean, Anna?”</p>

<p>“Exactly that, miss.” Anna spoke with positiveness.
“She moves as if she was in a dream.
She don’t eat, don’t talk, and I don’t believe she
sleeps.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” Polly bit viciously into a piece
of chocolate cake. “Well, it is not surprising,
Anna, that Miss Judith is upset. She and Mr.
Austin were very fond of each other.”</p>

<p>“Until he wished to marry her,” was Anna’s
shrewd retort. “Oh, we servants aren’t blind,
miss.”</p>

<p>“No, worse luck!” The low-spoken ejaculation
escaped Polly unawares, and she bit her lip.
Apparently it was not overheard, for Anna made
no comment, and Polly asked in haste, “How did
you know that Mr. Austin desired to marry Miss
Judith? You were not here at that time.”</p>

<p>“No, miss; but when the cablegram came telling
of Miss Judith’s unexpected marriage to
Major Richards, cook told me all about Mr.
Austin’s courtship, and how Mr. Hale encouraged
him. It was common gossip, miss, not only
below stairs but in society as well.” Seeing that
Polly had about completed her hastily eaten meal,
Anna rearranged the tray, preparatory to carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
it away. “You weren’t here then either,
miss, were you?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no.” Polly folded her napkin in its
exact creases with due regard to detail. “Don’t
worry about Miss Judith, she will be all right as
soon as the shock of Mr. Austin’s death wears
off.”</p>

<p>“Will she, miss?” Anna’s tone expressed
doubt. She lifted the tray, thought a moment,
replaced it, and walked to Polly’s side. “Do
you think Miss Judith’s quite happy in her marriage?”</p>

<p>“What!” Polly stared at her questioner in
blank astonishment “She and her husband are
ideally happy.”</p>

<p>“Are they, miss?” Anna shook a puzzled
head, then bent until her lips almost touched
Polly’s ear. “Major Richards came home from
Mr. Austin’s funeral just in time for dinner, and
went out immediately after&mdash;and&mdash;he didn’t
return until about six this morning.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” demanded Polly. Her
voice was sharp.</p>

<p>“I let him in, miss.” Anna picked up the tray
and poised for flight. “The Major said he had
mislaid his latchkey.”</p>

<p>Polly regarded the waitress as she crossed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>room, with critical eyes. In spite of the heavy
glass-topped tray, Anna walked with ease, her fine
upright carriage had frequently been commented
upon admiringly by Mrs. Hale’s dinner guests.</p>

<p>Polly turned back to her typewriter with renewed
distaste. A glance at her watch showed
that it was after one o’clock. For some minutes
she sat in indecision. Then, tossing her papers
into the drawer, she covered her machine and
went home.</p>

<p>She had been gone a bare ten minutes when the
door opened and Robert Hale stepped into the
den. On catching sight of the empty chair in
front of the typewriter, he frowned, and, going
over to the machine, lifted its leather cover. A
glance at its empty roll brought a shrug of the
shoulders, which was repeated when he looked at
his watch. Without sitting down he scanned the
furniture and the scrap basket finally caught his
eye.</p>

<p>Dropping into Polly’s chair, he picked up the
basket and examined the pieces of torn envelopes,
then the ball of paper claimed his attention and
he smoothed it out. He read the typewritten
words listlessly at first, then with slowly increasing
interest, and finally folded the sheet with care
and slipped it inside his pocket. Five minutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>later he was smoking placidly in his favorite chair
in the library.</p>

<p>Judith’s lack of appetite which had so distressed
Anna, the waitress, persisted, and during
luncheon she partook of only one hot roll and
sipped a cup of tea. Mrs. Hale, loquacious as
ever, paid no attention to the curt responses of
both her husband and daughter, and carried on a
lengthy conversation, much to her own satisfaction
and the secret enjoyment of Maud, the parlor
maid, who, in Anna’s absence, was serving
luncheon unaided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale’s volatile nature had thrown off the
depression of the past two days and, after the
funeral services in the mortuary chapel of Oak
Hill Cemetery, she had recovered from her inclination
to hysteria and was, to all intents and
purposes, her normal self again. At least, so the
servants had concluded from her excessive interest
in housekeeping affairs.</p>

<p>Not waiting for the dessert to be passed,
Judith pushed back her chair and rose.</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me, Mother,” she said, “I
will try to get a nap; I did not sleep very well
last night.”</p>

<p>Her father regarded her with concern. “My
dear child!” he exclaimed, startled by her pallor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>“you look completely used up. Agatha, what do
you mean by permitting Judith to get up this
morning? She needs entire rest.”</p>

<p>“Well, really, Robert,”&mdash;Mrs. Hale flushed;
her husband seldom addressed her in that tone&mdash;“Judith
has a husband to look after her; I,”
primly, “don’t interfere.”</p>

<p>The carmine rose in Judith’s white cheeks, then
receded, leaving them whiter than before. There
was a perceptible pause before she spoke.</p>

<p>“There is no cause for interference, Mother,”
she protested. “Joe insisted upon my remaining
in bed to-day, but I disobeyed him.”</p>

<p>Robert Hale laid down the cigar he was about
to light and again regarded her.</p>

<p>“Where was Joe last night?” he inquired, and
at the question Judith stiffened.</p>

<p>“He had to motor to Baltimore on business,”
she explained. “In returning, his chauffeur
drove recklessly and they met with an accident,
so that Joe never reached home until about six
o’clock this morning.”</p>

<p>“So Anna told me.” Hale was looking at his
cigar and not at his daughter. “Hard on Joe to
be sleepless for three nights running. When he
comes in ask him to look me up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father.” Judith had taken a few steps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>toward the entrance to the central hall, when her
mother’s shrill voice reached her.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t Joe here for luncheon?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He is lunching with friends at the Alibi
Club.” Judith laid one hand on the portière
nearest her and, turning, faced her parents.
“Why are you so interested in Joe’s whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“What a question?” Hale laughed lightly.
“We are interested in everything which concerns
you, Judith; and surely your husband is of paramount
importance. Run along, dearest, and get
that needed sleep,” and, rising, Hale crossed the
room and kissed her. The lips which Judith
barely touched to his were cold, and without another
word she hastened to her room.</p>

<p>Hale stood in the doorway gazing thoughtfully
into space; and his expression gained in seriousness.
“<i>The</i> Alibi,” he muttered. “Bah! <i>an</i>
alibi.”</p>

<p>Once in her bedroom, Judith locked the communicating
door between it and her boudoir; thus
secured from interruption, she paced up and down
her room, her footfall on the heavy carpet making
no sound. Back and forth, back and forth&mdash;utter
physical fatigue finally caused her to drop
into a chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>But while soft upholstery brought rest to her
tired body, it gave no mental relief. What had
come over her to lie&mdash;lie&mdash;lie&mdash;she, who had
been brought up by her New England grandmother
to abominate even the “delicate” white
lie of society. And she had lied, not to an outsider,
but to her father and mother, and lied
about her husband.</p>

<p>Judith drew a long breath. She had “explained”
Richards’ absence by drawing on her
imagination. In reality she had no knowledge
where he had gone after dinner the night before.
She had pretended to be asleep when he came in
at nearly seven in the morning and thrown himself
on the outside of the bed. He had slept the
sleep of utter exhaustion, and she had forborne
to wake him, had forborne to question him when
he finally awoke&mdash;and he had volunteered no
explanation. He had not returned for luncheon,
having left her with the remark that a stroll down
town would freshen him up&mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>A few bitter tears forced themselves under
Judith’s closed eyelids; it was the first rift in their
happy married life. His manner had been affectionate,
tender, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Judith dashed her hand across her eyes and
rose. It took her but a short time to change her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>house gown for a becoming suit. She was about
to leave the room when a thought struck her.
Going over to the mantel, she opened the small
leather box and took from under its coiled wires
the locket which had so engrossed her attention
on Wednesday morning. She balanced the
locket in her hand in indecision, then, closing the
box, she went to her bureau and from its upper
drawer took out a jewel box, opened it, and
dropped the locket among the other pieces of
jewelry the box contained, locked it, and put the
box back in place inside the drawer.</p>

<p>On her way to the front door Judith encountered
her mother and was promptly stopped.</p>

<p>“Judith!” Mrs. Hale’s accents indicated a
crescendo of astonishment. “My dear, didn’t
you hear your father say that you were to go to
bed?”</p>

<p>“Now, Mother, please”&mdash;Judith placed her
finger lightly against Mrs. Hale’s rouged lips.
“Not another word. As you said at luncheon,
I am a married woman now, and&mdash;I know best.”
Before Mrs. Hale could frame another remonstrance,
she had run out of the front door and
sprung into her electric car and driven off.</p>

<p>Traffic regulations prevented Judith from parking
her car in front of the tall office building
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>where “Latimer and House,” had their stock-brokerage
office, and she was obliged to walk
almost a block, a distance which she covered in
record time and arrived, somewhat breathless, in
the anteroom of that firm. At her request to see
the senior partner, she was at once taken to Frank
Latimer’s private office. With characteristic
directness she plunged at once into her errand.</p>

<p>“I have come to see you on business, Frank,”
she began, taking the chair his clerk placed for
her. “Confidential business.”</p>

<p>Latimer signed to his clerk to withdraw and
then turned to her.</p>

<p>“Anything I can do?” he asked. “I am entirely
at your service, Judith.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Judith’s quick smile enhanced her
beauty, and Latimer regarded her with admiration.
He and her Uncle John had been her pals
since the days when she wore short frocks. “I
want your advice about some bonds, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Surely.” Latimer drew a pad and pencil
toward him. “Have you decided on your investment?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to buy&mdash;I wish to sell.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Latimer showed his surprise, but she
gave him no opportunity to say anything further.</p>

<p>“How much would ten one hundred dollar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>bonds of the Troy Valve Company bring?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Latimer again glanced at her in surprise.
“They are selling above par,” he said. “Wait”&mdash;and
he consulted a printed table of figures&mdash;“to
be exact, 125-1/2&mdash;they fell off a point in
yesterday’s market.”</p>

<p>“Let me see”&mdash;Judith did a sum in mental
arithmetic&mdash;“that would net me about $1250.”</p>

<p>“A little more than that,” Latimer completed
his memorandum. “If you hold the bonds for
forty-eight hours they will recover&mdash;industrials
are in great demand now.”</p>

<p>“But I want the money.”</p>

<p>“But Judith,” he remonstrated, “don’t sacrifice
your bonds. Why not ask your father for a
loan?”</p>

<p>“No,”&mdash;Judith tempered the refusal&mdash;“Father
wouldn’t understand. I need the money
for&mdash;for an emergency.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here, Judith,”&mdash;Latimer pulled out
his check book&mdash;“won’t you let me help out?”</p>

<p>Judith flashed him a look of gratitude.
“Don’t think I am unappreciative of your generous
offer,” she exclaimed, “if I decline it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Judith,” and Latimer returned his
check book to the desk drawer. “But don’t sell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>your bonds. You can raise a thousand at any
bank by giving them as collateral with your note.”</p>

<p>Judith’s expression altered. “I hadn’t thought
of that,” she exclaimed. “Perhaps that would be
better.”</p>

<p>“Then if it will be of assistance to you I’ll
arrange it at the bank.” Judith nodded a vigorous
assent. “Will one thousand be enough?”</p>

<p>Judith considered a second. “Yes, I believe
so.”</p>

<p>“Have you the bonds with you?”</p>

<p>“No, they are in our safe at home.” Judith
glanced at her wrist-watch and saw that it was
half-past two. “I’ll bring the bonds to-morrow
morning; that will be time enough. I have the
numbers here, however,” and drawing out her
bank book from her bag, she turned to its back
pages. “They run from 37982 to 37991.” She
was on her feet before Latimer had laid down his
pencil. “I must hurry, Frank.” Impulsively
she clasped his hand in both of hers. “I can’t
begin to thank you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Latimer patted her gently on
the shoulder. “I am only too glad, Judith, to be
of service. How is your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is all right again.” Judith could not
restrain her impatience to be off. “Mother’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>rather fidgety; so are we all”&mdash;and an involuntary
sigh accompanied the words. “Austin’s
death was a shock we have not recovered from.
It’s&mdash;it’s numbed us”&mdash;hunting about for a
word.</p>

<p>“I understand,” and Latimer looked sympathetically
at her as he escorted her through his
private entrance into the corridor and to the elevator
shaft. “The newspapers said there were no
new developments in the case. Are you still annoyed
by the police?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” Judith stopped at the stairs.
“I can’t wait for the elevator; it’s only a few
flights, so good-by.” And waving her hand, she
almost ran down the steps.</p>

<p>As Latimer reëntered his private office he found
his head clerk standing by his desk with a number
of papers in his hand.</p>

<p>“These bonds have just been offered,” he explained,
extending the papers and Latimer glanced
at them. The next second he snatched up his
memorandum pad and compared the figures noted
thereon with the numbers engraved on the Troy
Valve bonds&mdash;37982. With quickened interest
Latimer turned over the bonds&mdash;each of the ten
numbers tallied with those on the memorandum
pad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Where did you get these Valve bonds?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“One of our new customers&mdash;I forget his
name&mdash;has just sold them to cover his margins.”</p>

<p>Latimer stared at his clerk. “Is the customer
still here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; at least he was a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Latimer strode to the outer office door and
opened it slightly; over a dozen men and women
were grouped about the ticker at the other end
of the room.</p>

<p>“Which is the customer?” he demanded,
keeping his voice low.</p>

<p>The clerk peered over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;that’s him,” he exclaimed; Latimer’s
excitement, though subdued, had communicated
itself to him and his grammar went astray.
“There, he’s going out of the front door.”</p>

<p>And Latimer, looking eagerly across the office,
was just in time to recognize the clear-cut features
and the straight soldierly figure. Joseph
Richards had disposed of the ten bonds owned by
his wife&mdash;which Judith desired to sell&mdash;to cover
his margins in stock speculations.</p>

<p>Latimer sat down in the nearest chair conscious
of a feeling of faintness for the first time
in his life.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KNAVE OF HEARTS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> death of Austin Hale under mysterious
circumstances had created a veritable
sensation in Washington, and the residents
of the National Capital read with avidity
every newspaper account. To the indignation of
the city editors and the staffs of newspaper men
few details were forthcoming from either Police
Headquarters or the Hale residence. Thus
thrown upon their own resources, imagination
played a large part in their “write-ups” of the
tragedy which, headed by display type of the
most sensational character, had but served to
whet the appetite of the reading public.</p>

<p>Robert Hale and his family occupied a prominent
position, both in the scientific world and in
society, and young Austin Hale, who had been
petted and indulged by his hosts of friends, was
genuinely mourned, and Anna, the waitress, detailed
Maud, the parlor maid, to remain at the
front door and receive the visiting cards bearing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>the message, “With sincere sympathy,” or perfumed
notes of condolence addressed to Mrs.
Hale, Judith, and John Hale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale looked with dismay at the formidable
pile of notes which Maud had handed to her with
a flourish at the close of dinner.</p>

<p>“I shall have to borrow Polly Davis to acknowledge
these messages of sympathy for me,
Robert,” she remarked, laying aside her lorgnette
and addressing her husband who, occupied with a
game of solitaire, sat at a near-by table in the
library.</p>

<p>Robert Hale considered the Knave of Hearts
before discarding it.</p>

<p>“Very well, if you need Polly’s services you
can have her,” he said, drawing another card
from the pack. “But it is for a limited time
only, recollect Polly is behind in my work.”</p>

<p>Judith, knitting industriously in her corner of
the big divan, stopped her busy needles for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Polly isn’t looking very well, Father,” she
stated slowly. “Don’t give her additional work;
she is not very strong.”</p>

<p>Hale looked displeased. “I am not giving her
additional work,” he protested. “Polly is behindhand,
and it is entirely her own fault. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>has been giving too much attention to society and
too little to her duties as my secretary.”</p>

<p>“Tut, Judith,” Mrs. Hale promptly took exception
to the implied criticism of her husband.
“Your father is quite right, he has been most
lenient with Polly and her flirtations.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think it is our place to judge Polly.”
Judith spoke with increasing earnestness. “The
girl tries hard to keep up with her work, and
your manuscript is not always easy, Father. You
ought to recollect, also, Mother, that she has led
a colorless life until this winter. She has a
mother entirely dependent upon her, and they are
cruelly poor.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for attending strictly to
her work,” grunted Hale, but his voice had softened,
as it always did when Judith was a special
pleader and that his daughter was much in earnest
was plainly evident. “Can’t you manage those
notes yourself, Agatha?”</p>

<p>“Let me answer them for you,” broke in Joe
Richards, and, rising from his seat under a standing
lamp where he had been reading an evening
newspaper, he walked over to the divan. “My
penmanship used to be pretty fair, and if Judith
will dictate what to say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” Judith’s blue eyes flashed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>him a grateful message. “Now, Father, if you
will consent, I wish to give Polly a&mdash;a vacation.”</p>

<p>Hale raised his head and contemplated her in
surprise. “A vacation?” he echoed. “Come,
Judith, that is a different matter; I am willing
not to give Polly additional work, but she must
complete her regular secretarial duties.”</p>

<p>Richards looked from father to daughter.
“Can’t I help out there, also, Mr. Hale?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“You cannot,” was the prompt response, and
under his tan Richards felt his color rise. Hale’s
manner to him could never be termed ingratiating.
If Judith caught the undercurrent of dislike in her
father’s abrupt refusal she gave no sign of it, as
she went placidly on with her knitting.</p>

<p>“I will see that you are supplied with a secretary
in Polly’s place,” she explained. “And if
you consent, Father, I plan to give her and her
mother a trip to Atlantic City.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, Judith!” Mrs. Hale dropped
the note she was reading and stared at her. “I
think such generosity is quite unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“Please”&mdash;Judith laid aside her knitting and
her voice was soft and winning. “Please, dear,
let me have my way in this. You, Father, will
benefit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Hale, in gathering up his playing cards,
dropped half of them on the floor, and he was
some seconds in collecting them, with the assistance
of Richards.</p>

<p>“How shall I benefit?” he asked, acknowledging
Richards’ courtesy with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>“By getting more efficient work,” Judith explained.
“Polly is on the point of a nervous
breakdown. Rest and sea breezes will put her
on her feet again; whereas if she is forced to
leave you on account of illness, you will still
be obliged to fill her place&mdash;perhaps for an indefinite
time.”</p>

<p>Hale stacked the cards neatly before him and
rising, put the small table back against the wall
in its customary place. “I’ll think over your
plan, Judith,” he agreed. “But mind you, I can’t
promise. Well, Agatha,”&mdash;as his wife, seeing
he was about to leave the library, rose also, a
bundle of papers in her hand&mdash;“what is it? Do
you wish to go on a vacation, also?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” Mrs. Hale took her courage
in both hands. “Here are some bills&mdash;they have
just come in,” hastening to forestall objections.
But, contrary to her expectations, Hale did not
indulge in his usual sarcastic comments regarding
her efforts to keep household accounts systematically&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
word “system” was not in Mrs.
Hale’s vocabulary.</p>

<p>“Bring the bills to my den,” he suggested,
“and I will go over them. Don’t stay up too
late, Judith,” he cautioned, turning back from the
door as Mrs. Hale, much relieved, hastily gathered
together her cherished account books, which never
balanced, and scurried out of the library ahead
of him in some trepidation lest he might change
his mind. Hale looked first at Judith and then at
her husband. “Don’t let Judith overtire herself,
Joe; we cannot have that.” Wheeling around,
he followed his wife upstairs.</p>

<p>Judith looked up from her knitting as Richards
paused by the side of the divan and regarded her.</p>

<p>“Do you feel ill, dearest?” he asked, and the
concern in his tone brought a touch of color to
her wan cheeks.</p>

<p>“No, only&mdash;” Judith hesitated. “Father is
right, I am very tired&mdash;I couldn’t sleep last
night.” Her usually clear voice quivered; another
second and Richards’ arms were around her
and her head was pillowed on his broad shoulder.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear love,” he murmured.
“Judith, don’t cry, my darling, don’t”&mdash;in distress,
as her self-control gave way. The storm
of tears ceased almost as abruptly as it started,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>and Judith met her husband’s tender glance with
a brave little smile.</p>

<p>“I am not often inclined to hysterics,” she
whispered. “Forgive me, dear.”</p>

<p>“Forgive you!” Richards laughed softly.
“Always, dear heart. Judith”&mdash;and his clasp
tightened&mdash;“you have no idea how precious you
are to me; how I worship you”&mdash;his strong
voice grew rough with emotion. “I am not half
worthy of you.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Judith placed a tender finger across
his lips. “Don’t say that, Joe. The world never
held such happiness for me until I met you, and
there has been no shadow until”&mdash;she faltered
a minute&mdash;“until yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Until yesterday?” Richards’ astonishment
was plain. “You mean Austin’s funeral?”</p>

<p>“No.” Judith colored warmly. “I mean
your leaving after dinner last night without saying
anything to me and&mdash;and&mdash;your getting
back so late, or rather, so early this morning.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Judith!” Richards chuckled,
then grew grave. “John asked me to go to the
club, and I left word with your father&mdash;didn’t
he give you the message?”</p>

<p>“No; Father felt badly early in the evening
and went to bed without my seeing him. Did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>you stay at the club all night?” again she colored.
“I was awake when you came in this morning.”</p>

<p>“You were!” Richards smiled wryly. “And
I thought you asleep and did my best not to
awaken you. At the club I met Sandy Nichols,
and he asked me to run over to Baltimore and
try out his new Pierce Arrow&mdash;he was my pal
in the A. E. F., you know,” he interpolated.
“We expected to be back before midnight, but we
first lost our way owing to a detour, and then
the car broke down on the return trip. I tried
to telephone, but Central declared the house would
not answer.”</p>

<p>“Mother had the phone disconnected; she insisted
it disturbed Father.” Judith’s spirits were
returning, and the glance she gave him was full
of mischief. “You have no idea how worried
I was.”</p>

<p>“Judith!” Richards held her face between
his hands and gazed straight into her eyes.
“Judith, you weren’t jealous?”</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly her eyes fell before his ardent
look and the rich color mantled almost to her
brow. “Yes, I was,” she confessed, and holding
her in close embrace, he kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Judith,” he said, “never doubt my loyalty to
you&mdash;my devotion.” He stopped, hesitated, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>his voice grew even lower. “You are my life&mdash;my
religion.”</p>

<p>“Joe!” Startled by the intensity of his manner,
Judith stood up. “You must not exalt me.
I am an ordinary mortal, subject to error.”</p>

<p>“No.” Richards rose and faced her, his hands
resting lightly on her shoulders. “In my eyes
you can do no wrong.”</p>

<p>Richards stood tall and straight before her, his
six feet two of sturdy manhood matched by her
slender willowy figure, for Judith was above the
usual height for women. Maud, the parlor maid,
who had come in search of Mrs. Hale, felt a
sympathetic thrill as she noted the rapt expression
of the lovers and stole away without disturbing them.</p>

<p>“Joe,”&mdash;Judith slipped her hand inside his and
gave it a gentle squeeze&mdash;“this is the first really
happy moment I have known since I regained my
senses in my boudoir on Tuesday night, or rather
Wednesday morning. I do not understand how
I came to faint.”</p>

<p>Richards glanced at her for an instant. Then
his gaze traveled across the room and rested on
the spot where Austin Hale’s body had lain that
fateful Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>“You had reached the limit of endurance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>dearest,” he declared. “Tell me,”&mdash;and again
his eyes sought hers&mdash;“you heard nothing&mdash;no
sound of a struggle, no scream?”</p>

<p>Judith shook her head and the pathetic look
which Richards had grown to know crept into
her eyes. “I am deaf.”</p>

<p>“But with this, dear,” and he touched the earpiece
of the “globia-phone” which she was wearing.
“Surely you could hear something.”</p>

<p>“I did not have it on Tuesday night,” she explained.
“My head ached and when I braided
my hair I took it off, for even the slight weight
of the instrument intensified the pain. And you
must remember that the walls of this house are
sound-proof; I could not hear, even when I was
wearing this earphone, anything transpiring downstairs
while I was in our boudoir.”</p>

<p>“In our boudoir!” The words slipped
mechanically from Richards. “Don’t you recollect,
dearest, that I found you unconscious in the
front hall downstairs?”</p>

<p>“In the front hall?” Judith faltered and
dropped her eyes. “Why&mdash;I&mdash;I thought you
found me in our boudoir. I revived there.”</p>

<p>“I carried you upstairs.” Richards bit his lip
as a faint “Oh!” broke from Judith. She made
no other comment, and he continued, “How did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>it happen that your earphone was in your father’s
safe?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he picked it up and absent-mindedly
put it there.”</p>

<p>“But, Judith,”&mdash;Richards glanced away from
her&mdash;“your father stated that he was taken ill
with the ‘flu’ on Friday a week ago, and that
he did not come downstairs until yesterday.
How then could he have put the earphone in the
safe on Tuesday night?”</p>

<p>“I did not say he put it there Tuesday night,”
Judith spoke a bit sharply. “It may have been
there for days and I never would have missed it,
for I have about every ear instrument ever invented.
Father is always buying some new invention,
and you will find them scattered all over
the house, much to Mother’s annoyance.” Judith
had spoken with unusual rapidity and she came
to a breathless pause.</p>

<p>“Judith,”&mdash;Richards hesitated a brief second&mdash;“what
brought you downstairs on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>“I was looking for you,” she confessed. “You
said that you would return early”&mdash;with faint
reproach.</p>

<p>“Did you see Austin?” The question came
with marked reluctance, and in the deepening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>silence Richards caught the tick-tock of the clock
over the fireplace. His hands tightened their
clasp and he grew conscious that hers had grown
cold.</p>

<p>“I had no knowledge of Austin’s presence in
the house,” she stated and winced. “Don’t, Joe,
you are hurting me”&mdash;and Richards awakened
to the fact that he had pressed her hands with
such force that her wedding ring had cut into
the delicate flesh.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he murmured, and, raising her
hands, pressed them to his lips.</p>

<p>“Joe,”&mdash;Judith had grown singularly pale and
the hand she disengaged from his and laid on
his arm was not quite steady&mdash;“believe me,
dear, when I say that I heard nothing on that
Tuesday night preceding or following Austin’s
death.”</p>

<p>“You heard nothing,” Richards repeated;
neither looked at the other. “I believe you, sweetheart.”
He kissed her gently. “You must not
worry so, Judith; you will make yourself ill, and
I fear I have kept you up talking much too long,”&mdash;in
deep contrition as the dock chimed ten.
“Come, dear.” And with his arm thrown protectingly
about her shoulders, he strolled with her
to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>As they passed the card table Judith caught
sight of a playing card lying on the rug and her
orderly instinct caused her to stoop and pick it
up just as the portières parted and Mrs. Hale
dashed breathlessly into the library.</p>

<p>“You haven’t gone upstairs!” she exclaimed,
much relieved. “The most dreadful thing has
happened.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Judith and her husband
in unison.</p>

<p>“Anna has fallen and sprained her ankle.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Judith’s relief took the form
of a short laugh.</p>

<p>“All? Good gracious, to have a waitress laid
up is serious enough, without having that waitress,
Anna,” Mrs. Hale spoke in scandalized disapproval.
“Anna is the most useful person in the house.”</p>

<p>“I know she is,” agreed Judith. “I spoke in
haste, Mother, but you frightened me; I thought
something had happened to&mdash;to Father.”</p>

<p>“Let me call a doctor,” suggested Richards
practically and walked toward the desk phone.
But Mrs. Hale stopped him.</p>

<p>“I have already telephoned,” she explained.
“McLane is detained at the hospital with a serious
case and can’t come, but he gave me explicit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>directions over the phone, and I shall carry them
out.” Mrs. Hale had unbounded confidence in
her medical knowledge, a confidence, however,
not shared by the members of her family. “But
I find that we have no arnica in the medicine
chest.”</p>

<p>“Let me go for it,” volunteered Richards and,
not waiting for Mrs. Hale’s voluble thanks, he
started for the door, pausing only to call to
Judith. “Run upstairs, Judith, don’t wait for
me.” Snatching up his hat and overcoat, he disappeared
out of the house, in his haste never hearing
Mrs. Hale’s parting injunction. She turned
with a worried air to her daughter.</p>

<p>“I declare, Judith, I forgot to ask him to get
bandages.”</p>

<p>“I have some.” Judith slipped her arm inside
her mother’s. “Come up to my boudoir and then
I will go with you to see Anna.”</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later, the arnica
applied and the swollen ankle neatly bandaged,
Judith came downstairs in quest of a decanter
of whiskey which her father kept carefully secreted
in the dining room. Anna had expressed
a desire for a “nightcap” and Mrs. Hale had
begged Judith to prepare it for her.</p>

<p>Judith poured out a liberal portion of Scotch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>replaced the decanter in its recess behind the sideboard,
and then hastened toward the door, intending
to add the hot water when she reached
Anna’s bedroom. As she passed the drawn
portières across the entrance to the library, her
eyes caught a ray of light showing between its
folds. Judith halted in surprise and, parting the
portières, looked inside the library. Seated in
her father’s favorite chair was her uncle, John
Hale. By his side stood Frank Latimer, both
with their backs partly turned toward her. Her
uncle’s raised voice reached her in the stillness
and she caught the mention of her husband’s
name.</p>

<p>“I know very little about Joe Richards’ antecedents,”
John Hale stated. “He seems a good
fellow, whole-souled, well-set-up&mdash;educated.
We knew nothing of Judith’s marriage until her
cable came.”</p>

<p>“How about Richards’ financial standing?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask, Frank?” John Hale regarded
his friend in surprise.</p>

<p>Latimer moved nearer. “The question is
prompted by our long friendship, John, by my
affection for Judith.” The gravity of his manner
startled the listening girl. “I had to see you
to-night; I could not rest until I did.” Latimer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>polished his round spectacles and adjusted them
with care. “What we say is in confidence. It
is imperative that I get some information about
Richards, particularly as to his financial standing.
Has he money?”</p>

<p>“He appears to have plenty of ready cash,”
admitted John Hale slowly. “I heard to-day
that he has applied for a position with the Ludlow
Locomotive Works.” He paused. “Tuesday
Richards went to our bank and asked for a loan,
offered to supply bonds as collateral, and gave us
as references&mdash;that is how I learned of the transaction.”</p>

<p>“Did the bank make the loan?”</p>

<p>“Not yet; the treasurer consulted me, and has
the matter under advisement.” Again he paused.
“It greatly depends upon the bonds he offers.”</p>

<p>Latimer stared at his companion. “Good
Lord!” he groaned, and again wiped his glasses.
“Listen, John, and don’t breathe a word of what
I say, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” and the pledge rang out clearly.</p>

<p>“Judith came to my office this afternoon and
asked me to sell ten bonds of the Troy Valve
Company. I advised her to borrow from her
bank, offering them as collateral, and before she
left she gave me the bond numbers, 37982 to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>37991. She hadn’t been gone five minutes when
my clerk brought me in ten bonds of the Troy
Valve Company bearing those identical numbers.
See for yourself,” and he laid a bundle of papers
in John Hale’s hand. “The bonds had been sold
to us not ten minutes before to cover margins in
stock speculations when the market fell to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” urged John Hale.</p>

<p>“The speculator and the man who sold the
bonds are one and the same person&mdash;Joseph
Richards. Now, how did Richards get hold of
Judith’s bonds which, mind you, she expected to
bring to me to-morrow?”</p>

<p>John Hale, who had followed Latimer’s slow
speech with absorbed attention, answered almost
automatically.</p>

<p>“Robert confided to me this evening that on
careful examination of the contents of his safe to-day,
he found that Judith’s bonds were missing.”
He stopped, then added, “We have not told
Judith.”</p>

<p>As the full meaning of her uncle’s words
dawned on Judith she swayed upon her feet and
in desperation clutched the glass and prevented
it from slipping through her shaking fingers.
Very softly she tiptoed through the dining room
and out into the central hall. At the stairs she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>paused and, raising the glass, swallowed some of
Anna’s “nightcap.” She was hardly conscious
of the fiery undiluted liquor which burned her
tongue and throat, but under the false strength
it engendered she hurried up the staircase and
came face to face with her husband on the top
landing.</p>

<p>His face cleared at sight of her. “I was
hurrying to find you,” he explained, and took the
glass from her. “Your mother told me that she
had sent you for this. I’ll take it to Anna. Go
to bed, dearest.” And he sped away as Judith
turned into their boudoir.</p>

<p>With slow, uncertain steps Judith made her
way to her dressing table and fell rather than sat
in the chair standing before it.</p>

<p>Her bonds had been stolen&mdash;Joe had sold them
to Latimer to cover losses in speculation. The
words rang their changes&mdash;but their distinct
meaning beat itself against her brain and, with a
low moan of anguish, she bowed her head upon
her arms, thereby displacing the playing card
which she had picked up earlier that evening in
the library and flung unheeded on her dressing
table. The red of it caught and held her eye,
and suddenly she laughed loudly&mdash;unrestrainedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“The Knave of Hearts!” she gasped between
her bursts of merriment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Judith’s hysterical laughter echoed through
the open door into the boudoir, a figure just entering
it, paused, listened a moment, then with bent
head, retreated cautiously into the hall and stole
silently away.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> sight of John Hale towering head and
shoulders above the others in the outer
office of Latimer and House, Stockbrokers,
the senior partner hastily excused himself
from several persistent clients and sent his
messenger to bring John Hale into his private
office.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded without further greeting.
“Well, has the night brought counsel?”</p>

<p>John Hale tipped the revolving chair he was
occupying back to its limit before replying.</p>

<p>“The night brought nothing but sleeplessness,”
he groaned. “Whichever way you look at it,
Frank, it’s a damnable situation. Judith’s bonds
missing from her father’s safe and discovered in
her husband’s possession, and Austin found
stabbed to death within a few feet of the opened
safe in which her bonds were kept. My God!
Frank,”&mdash;he bent nearer and Latimer saw the
beads of perspiration standing on his brow,&mdash;“do
you realize all that that implies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“You mean that Joe Richards opened the safe,
stole the bonds and, caught in the act by Austin,
killed him?” asked Latimer.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s about it.” John Hale twirled his
walking stick about. “Well, it tallies, doesn’t
it?” and only by an effort of will did he hide a
touch of eagerness.</p>

<p>Latimer pondered a moment before replying.
“Yes, it tallies,” he agreed, “but you have no
evidence to substantiate it. For instance, to open
the safe Richards had to know the combination.”</p>

<p>“Well, he might have picked it up.”</p>

<p>“True, he might have, but you will have to
prove that he did.”</p>

<p>“I prove it?” John Hale’s heavy brows met
in a scowl. “That’s the detective’s job, not
mine.”</p>

<p>“I used the pronoun to imply the prosecution,
and not in its personal application,” Latimer explained.
“Where was Richards on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>“Playing billiards at the club.”</p>

<p>“Have you proof of the exact time he left
there?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll get it,” and John Hale’s tone implied
grim determination.</p>

<p>“Then suppose you make inquiries at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>club,” suggested Latimer; “but be guarded, John.
Every one’s attention is focused on Austin’s murder
and you might start an ugly scandal.”</p>

<p>John Hale reddened. “Well, what if I do?”
he grumbled. “The situation couldn’t be much
worse than it is to-day,”&mdash;shooting a defiant look
at his friend. “Austin murdered under mysterious
circumstances, and the police haunting our
house, not to mention the morbid sight-seers who
gather about it. I cannot stir out of the place
without encountering curious glances. Even at
the club there’s excitement whenever I appear&mdash;and
the newspaper men!” He struck the desk
a resounding blow with his clenched fist. “Damn
it! If Richards murdered Austin he’ll swing for
it&mdash;I don’t care if he’s married Judith a dozen
times over.”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy,” cautioned Latimer. “Cool
down, John, and let us discuss this matter rationally.
What have we discovered against Richards?”</p>

<p>“That he was playing the market, that he was
in need of funds, and that he had in his possession
bonds belonging to Judith which had been
stolen on Tuesday night from my brother’s safe,
near which we found Austin’s body in the small
hours of Wednesday morning.” John Hale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>moderated his excited manner. “Pretty damning
evidence.”</p>

<p>“As far as it goes,” agreed Latimer. “Now,
to make it conclusive you must prove: first, that
Richards was at your house between Tuesday
midnight and one <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Wednesday; and secondly,
that he knew the combination of your brother’s
safe. Recollect, it was not forced open.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it my business to find out.” John
Hale reached for his hat and his gloves which
he had tossed on the desk. “I am also going
to have inquiries made regarding Richards’
career.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea,” exclaimed Latimer.
“But you had better employ a private detective
agency, John, rather than the local police. Try
the Burroughs Company, they handled some work
for our firm when Johnston, the bank cashier,
hypothecated stock belonging to us.”</p>

<p>“Where’s their office?” asked John Hale,
jotting down the name on the back of an envelope.</p>

<p>“In the Fendall Building, corner of John
Marshall Place.”</p>

<p>John Hale completed the address and replaced
the envelope in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>“Listen, Frank,” he began. “Austin’s murder
was unpremeditated&mdash;the weapon used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>proves that. No man would deliberately kill another
with a pair of shears.”</p>

<p>Latimer shook his head in doubt. “You are
taking a great deal for granted,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” vigorously. “Austin
caught Richards going through the safe and
Richards grabbed the first thing handy&mdash;Judith’s
shears.” Latimer said nothing, and after a
brief pause John Hale continued. “The crime
was committed by some one familiar with the
habits of our household&mdash;the police claim that.
No better time could have been selected for rifling
Robert’s safe. He was ill in bed, and Agatha
and I were attending the French Embassy reception
and, by the way, we decided to go only at
the last moment&mdash;that’s an important point.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Richards was present when I told Agatha that
I would take her to the reception, and he left the
house immediately afterward.” John Hale was
becoming excited again. “Thus, Richards knew
that the coast would be clear.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, he was aware that Judith was at
home, and the servants, also,” objected Latimer.</p>

<p>“Sure, and he knew that our servants retire
early. Anna sees to the closing of the house, and
she is very strict with the other servants.” John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>Hale rose abruptly and emphasized his words by
striking his cane against the floor. “And Richards
knew that Judith would not be likely to hear
him, and if she did&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?” as John Hale paused.</p>

<p>“He probably had a plausible excuse handy.
Oh, he could have manufactured some story which
Judith would have swallowed,” retorted John
Hale. “Remember, they haven’t been married
long.”</p>

<p>Latimer frowned. “Who is going to tell
Judith about the theft of her bonds?” he asked,
rising also.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you.” John Hale moved uneasily
and glanced away from his companion. “Judith
came to you about her bonds.”</p>

<p>“Dash it all, John!” Latimer spoke with temper.
“I’m damned if I will. Don’t you realize
that Judith worships her husband?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not the first time a woman has been
deceived in a man,” replied Hale cynically.
“What did she marry for in such an all-fired
hurry? I am sorry for Judith, but she must
‘dree her weird.’”</p>

<p>Whatever reply Latimer intended making was
interrupted by the entrance of a clerk.</p>

<p>“This special delivery letter has just come for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>you, sir,” he explained handing it to Latimer.
Then, with a polite bow to John Hale, of which
the latter took not the slightest notice, the clerk
departed.</p>

<p>Latimer tore open the envelope and ran his
eyes down the written page to the signature. An
exclamation escaped him.</p>

<p>“It is from Judith,” he said. “Listen:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frank</span>:</p>

<p>I gave my Valve bonds to Joe to use as he saw fit,
and he tells me that he took the shares to you and you
were kind enough to arrange the business for him, so
I shall not need the $1,000 after all.</p>

<p>Please don’t tell the family that I’ve become a bit of
a gambler; Joe doesn’t quite approve of a woman
speculating, but&mdash;he’s dear about it.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your kindness.</p>

<p class="right2">Faithfully,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Judith Richards</span>.</p></div>

<p>Latimer and John Hale stared at each other.</p>

<p>“Let me see that letter,” the latter demanded,
and he read it twice before handing it back to
Latimer. “What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>Latimer laughed heartily. “Thank God I
shan’t have to break any unpleasant news to her,”
he exclaimed. “But the inconsistency of women!
To come to me for advice and then get her husband
to do exactly what I advised her not to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“What was your advice?”</p>

<p>“To use the bonds as collateral at a bank and
not sell them.”</p>

<p>John Hale studied him in thoughtful silence
for a minute.</p>

<p>“When did Richards bring the bonds here,
Frank?” he asked. “Was it some time after
Judith left?”</p>

<p>“No; come to think of it, he must have been
in the outer office when Judith was talking to me,”
responded Latimer, and his face grew grave once
again.</p>

<p>“And Judith states”&mdash;John Hale picked up
his niece’s letter&mdash;“‘I gave my Valve bonds to
Joe to use as he saw fit and he tells me that he
took the bonds to you&mdash;’ Did Judith mention
to you where she had the bonds?”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, she did say that
they were in her father’s safe.” Latimer
eyed John Hale sharply. “What are you driving
at?”</p>

<p>“Simply this, that if Richards was in your
front office with the bonds in his possession, they
could not have been where Judith thought them&mdash;in
her father’s safe. Secondly,”&mdash;and John
Hale’s voice deepened&mdash;“there was no time for
Judith to return home, get the bonds and give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>them to Richards <i>before</i> he sold them to your
clerk here in your outer office. Isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Latimer’s worried look returned.
“By Jove, you think&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“That Judith has discovered that her bonds
are missing.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose your brother told her?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so, for he swore me to
secrecy,” replied John Hale. “No, Judith must
have gone to get the bonds and found them missing
from the safe.”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord! How did she know that
her husband had brought the bonds to me?” demanded
Latimer.</p>

<p>“Ask me something easy.” Hale swung his
cane around and stepped briskly to the door.
“But depend on it, Frank, I’ll find an answer to
that question before I’m many hours older.”
And he banged out of the door.</p>

<p>Latimer strode thoughtfully up and down his
office, then reseated himself at his desk.</p>

<p>“What’s come over John?” he muttered.
“He seemed anxious,”&mdash;he paused&mdash;“no, more
than anxious,&mdash;determined,&mdash;to fix the guilt on
Joe Richards.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and eyed Judith’s letter,
reading it slowly, conning over the words, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>when he straightened up there was a gleam of
frank admiration in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You are a loyal woman, Judith,” he exclaimed,
unconscious that he spoke aloud. “As
well as ‘a bit of a gambler.’”</p>

<span class="smaller">HALF A SHEET</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>olly Davis</span> closed the vestibule door
of her home in C Street with a veritable
slam and proceeded up the street oblivious
of greetings from several of her neighbors.
The street, celebrated in its day for having among
the occupants of its stately old-fashioned brick
houses such personages as John C. Fremont, John
C. Calhoun, and General Winfield Scott, was
chiefly given over to modern business enterprises,
and only a few “Cave-dwellers” (the name bestowed
upon Washingtonians by an earnest
“climber” to its exclusive resident circles) still
occupied the homes of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Polly slackened her swift walk into a saunter
as she turned the corner from C Street into John
Marshall Place. On reaching D Street she accelerated
her speed somewhat on catching sight of
an approaching street car, but it did not stop to
take on passengers, and Polly walked back to the
curb with an uncomplimentary opinion of the
service of one of Washington’s public utilities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>She waited in indecision on the corner, then opening
her hand bag, took from it a scrap of paper
and consulted the name written thereon. After
studying the paper for a minute, she turned and
eyed the large, red brick and stone trimmed office
building standing on the southeast corner facing
the District Court House. She had seen the
Fendall Building innumerable times since her
childhood days, but never before had it held her
interest.</p>

<p>There was a certain set air to Polly’s shoulders,
which, to one acquainted with her characteristics,
indicated obstinacy, as she crossed the street and
entered the Fendall Building. She paused in the
lobby in front of the floor directory and then
continued to the second story. At the far end of
the corridor she stopped before a closed door
bearing on its ground glass the title, in gold lettering:</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><b>Burroughs Detective Agency</b><br />
<span class="smcap">Alfred Burroughs</span>, <i>Prop.</i></p>

<p>Polly returned to her hand bag the scrap of
paper which she still held tightly between the
fingers of her left hand, took out a visiting card,
and stepped inside the office. There was no one
in the room, and, with a surprised glance about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>her, Polly crossed to a door evidently leading to
an inner office. The door was only partly closed,
and through the opening a familiar voice floated
out to her:</p>

<p>“I depend upon your discretion, Mr. Burroughs.
Remember, my name must not be mentioned
in connection with your employment in the
case&mdash;” The grating sound of chairs being
pushed back followed, and any answer was
drowned thereby.</p>

<p>The hand which Polly had extended to knock
against the panel of the door fell nerveless to her
side. With eyes distended to twice their normal
size, she retraced her footsteps out of the office
and the building.</p>

<p>When Polly reached the Hale residence she
was admitted by the parlor maid instead of the
ever smiling Anna.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hale left word, Miss Polly, that you
were to go to Mrs. Hale,” Maud announced, helping
Polly off with her coat and hat.</p>

<p>“Oh,” Polly paused. “Where is Mrs.
Hale?”</p>

<p>“I don’t rightly know, miss.” Maud emerged
from the depths of the hall closet where she had
hung Polly’s wraps. “Mrs. Hale came in not
three minutes ago. I think she has gone to her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>bedroom. Will you have some lunch now, miss,
or a little later?”</p>

<p>“A little later, thanks”&mdash;Polly regarded the
hall clock. “I had no idea it was nearly noon.
You will find me with Mrs. Hale, Maud.”</p>

<p>“Very good, miss,” and they separated, the
maid going to her pantry, and Polly in search of
Mrs. Hale. She found that energetic matron
just crossing the hall toward Judith’s boudoir.
At the sound of Polly’s hail she faced around.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Polly!” Mrs. Hale frequently
asked the obvious. “My dear, aren’t you very
late to-day?”</p>

<p>Polly blushed at the emphasis on the adjective.
“A little later than ordinary,” she answered good-naturedly.
“I will make up the time, Mrs. Hale,
and your husband’s manuscript will be completed
without delay. Maud said that your husband left
word that I was to report to you.”</p>

<p>“Did he?” Mrs. Hale regarded her in some
perplexity. “Why, last night he decided that
you were not strong enough to aid me in answering
my letters; he must have changed his mind,
for he wouldn’t have sent you to me for anything
else.”</p>

<p>Polly’s attention had been caught by one phrase
and the rest of Mrs. Hale’s speech went unheeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Your husband said I was not strong?” she
questioned. “I am quite well. What made him
think otherwise?”</p>

<p>“Judith put the idea in his head.” Mrs. Hale
led the way into the boudoir as she spoke and
selected a chair near her daughter’s desk, on
which were piled the notes of condolence, in anticipation
of Richards’ answering them under
Judith’s supervision. “Judith is very much worried
about your health, my dear.”</p>

<p>“That is very kind of Judith.” Polly slipped
into the seat before Judith’s desk at a sign from
Mrs. Hale. “But your daughter is mistaken. I
am not in the least ill.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it.” Mrs. Hale looked
at her husband’s pretty secretary with approval.
“Judith is always so positive in her statements.
I could not see that you looked run down, but
she insisted that you needed a change, and
arranged with Mr. Hale to give you a vacation.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” The frigid exclamation escaped
Polly unwittingly, but Mrs. Hale apparently was
oblivious of the girl’s chilly reception of Judith’s
plans.</p>

<p>“I am glad you don’t require a vacation,” she
went on. “Mr. Hale is particularly in need of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>your services, and it would be most unkind to
leave him in the lurch.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of doing so, Mrs. Hale,”
declared Polly with some warmth. “Aside from
the question of my not being able to afford a
vacation, gratitude to Mr. Hale, alone, would prevent
me from going away just now.” She passed
one restless hand over the other. “What possessed
Judith to wish to get rid of me?”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear,”&mdash;Mrs. Hale held up a protesting
hand&mdash;“don’t get such a notion in your
head. Judith is devoted to you; we all are, but
she imagined&mdash;you know Judith greatly depends
upon her imagination&mdash;she is so, so,”&mdash;hunting
about for a word&mdash;“so shut in with her deafness,
and she is forever imagining things about
people.”</p>

<p>“And what does she imagine about me?” asked
Polly, as Mrs. Hale came to a somewhat incoherent
pause.</p>

<p>“That you were on the point of nervous prostration&mdash;”</p>

<p>Polly laughed a bit unsteadily. “Only the
wealthy can afford nervous ‘prosperity,’ and I am
not in that class,” she said. “I must work&mdash;work!”
She spoke with nervous vehemence;
Mrs. Hale’s surprised expression checked her; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>with an effort she regained her self-control.
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Answer these notes,” and Mrs. Hale laid her
hand on them. “Take this black-edged note
paper,” holding out a box she had brought with
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale’s powers of observation were wool-gathering
as she dictated her answers, first reading
each letter in a monotone&mdash;in itself enough
to try the steadiest nerves&mdash;before composing
its answer; then losing her place and having to
be prompted, which added to her already confused
state of mind. Every expression of sympathy in
the notes brought tears in its train, and if the
steady application of Mrs. Hale’s handkerchief
proved an additional barrier to the speedy completion
of her task, it also prevented her perceiving
the wavering writing of Polly’s swiftly moving
pen.</p>

<p>“Austin was very much beloved,” she remarked.
“I cannot understand, as I told my
husband over and over, I cannot understand who
would have a motive for killing him. It is beyond
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Polly. She laid down her
pen and rubbed her stiff fingers. There still remained
numerous notes to answer. “Dear Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Hale, let me finish answering these later on.
You must be exhausted.”</p>

<p>“No, they must be completed now,” Mrs. Hale
spoke with firmness, and Polly, hiding her unsteady
fingers under pretense of searching for
another pen among Judith’s papers, resigned herself
to the situation. “Judith suggested that I
order an engraved card of acknowledgment, but I
desire an individual letter sent to each of our
friends. It will not take much more of your
time,” observing Polly’s eyes stray to her wrist-watch.</p>

<p>“Will you let me complete the letters this afternoon?”
Polly asked. “I have not touched my
regular work for your husband, and it is nearly
your luncheon hour.”</p>

<p>“Luncheon will be half an hour later to-day,”
responded Mrs. Hale. “Anna is laid up and
Maud asked for more time. She is not very
quick at her work, you know.”</p>

<p>“Anna ill! That is too bad,” exclaimed Polly.
“I hope it is nothing serious.”</p>

<p>“A sprained ankle.” Mrs. Hale leaned back
in her chair and relaxed; she felt the need of a
little gossip, for in spite of her insistence on completing
her letters, the steady application was
commencing to wear upon her. “When anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
goes wrong with Anna the whole house is
upset.”</p>

<p>“She is certainly a domestic treasure,” agreed
Polly. “How many years has she been with
you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale considered before answering.
“She came to us at the time Austin had typhoid
fever; the trained nurse wanted a helper&mdash;what
did she call Anna?”</p>

<p>“Nurse’s aide?” suggested Polly.</p>

<p>“That was it,” and Mrs. Hale smiled. “We
persuaded her to stay on as waitress.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage it, Mrs. Hale?” asked
Polly. Another glance at her watch showed her
that the announcement of luncheon must shortly
occur, and she wished above all not to resume
answering letters of condolence. “It has always
struck me that Anna was very much above the
regular servant class.”</p>

<p>“So she is, my dear,” Mrs. Hale was launched
on her favorite topic. “But Mr. Hale offered
her such high wages, really ridiculous wages at
the time, that it wouldn’t have been in human
nature to resist his offer. I must say for Anna
that she has earned every cent we pay her.
Lately”&mdash;Mrs. Hale hesitated and surveyed the
boudoir to make sure that the hall door was closed&mdash;“lately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Anna has appeared so&mdash;so absent-minded.
Do you suppose it can be a love affair?”</p>

<p>“The most natural supposition in the world,”
smiled Polly. “Anna is a remarkably pretty
girl.”</p>

<p>“So she is,” Mrs. Hale nodded her head in
agreement. “I suspect it is that new clerk in the
drug store. I meet them quite often walking together,
and I called Austin’s attention to them
when he was last in Washington, just six weeks
ago to-day.” Mrs. Hale looked at the calendar
hanging near Judith’s desk to be sure of her facts.
“Polly, if I tell you something will you promise
to hold your tongue about it?”</p>

<p>Polly stared at Mrs. Hale&mdash;the latter’s tone
had completely changed and her customary
irresponsible manner had become one of suppressed
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mrs. Hale,” she replied, and her
manner reflected the other’s seriousness. “I will
consider whatever you say as confidential.”</p>

<p>“First, answer this, on your word of honor,”&mdash;and
Polly’s wonderment grew as Mrs. Hale
hitched her chair nearer, and her voice gained in
seriousness. “Have you come across a small
piece of yellow paper; it is folded and has the
word ‘Copy’ as a watermark?” Seeing Polly’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>uncomprehending stare, she added impatiently,
“The kind reporters use in newspaper offices.
Have you seen such a paper among my husband’s
correspondence?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Hale; not as you describe it,” Polly
shook a puzzled head. “I may not have noticed
the word ‘Copy,’ though. Was there anything
else to identify it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale thought a minute, then came to a
decision. “It is no matter,” she said brusquely.
“Forget I mentioned it; there is a more pressing
matter”&mdash;from her silver mesh purse she drew
out a much creased letter. “Read that,” she
directed, and held it almost under Polly’s nose,
“but not aloud, read it to yourself.”</p>

<p>Obediently Polly took the paper and, holding
it at the proper focus, read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Agatha</span>:</p>

<p>I started for San Francisco on the midnight train,
so forgive this hasty scrawl in answer to your long
letter. I will see the happy bride and groom on my
return. Sorry Uncle Robert doesn’t like Richards.
I found on inquiry that Richards&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Polly turned the letter over&mdash;the second sheet
was missing. The young girl looked in bewilderment
at Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p>“Have you the end of the letter?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“No, that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“This”&mdash;Polly turned it over again. “Why,
it is not even signed.”</p>

<p>“But it is in Austin Hale’s handwriting,”
asserted Mrs. Hale. “You know it is,
Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly again inspected the clear, distinctive writing.
She had seen it too often to be mistaken in
identifying the chirography.</p>

<p>“It looks like Austin’s writing,” she qualified.
“When did you receive the letter and what does
it mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean? We’ll come to that later,” Mrs. Hale
lowered her voice to a confidential pitch. “You
see the date there,” indicating it, and Polly nodded.
“The letter was begun on Tuesday in New
York, and Austin was murdered between Tuesday
midnight and one <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Wednesday <i>here in
Washington</i>.”</p>

<p>“He was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course he was.” Patience was never Mrs.
Hale’s strong point. “Now, Polly, let us dissect
this letter. On Tuesday in New York Austin
states that he is to take the midnight train for
San Francisco; instead of that he comes to Washington.
Why?” And having propounded the
conundrum, Mrs. Hale sat back and contemplated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>Polly. There was a distinct pause before the girl
replied.</p>

<p>“I cannot answer your question, Mrs. Hale.”
Polly avoided raising her eyes as she turned the
letter over once again and looked at the blank
side. It was a small-sized sheet of note paper
of good quality, and Austin’s large writing completely
filled the first page. Polly held the letter
nearer Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p>“The back sheet has been torn off,” she pointed
out. “See, the edges are rough and uneven.”</p>

<p>“So I observed.” Mrs. Hale was a trifle nonplussed.
She had anticipated more excitement on
Polly’s part, and the girl’s composure was a surprise.
That Polly was maintaining her composure
through sheer will power, Mrs. Hale was too
obtuse to detect. She was convinced, however,
that Polly had been more than ordinarily attracted
by Austin Hale’s good looks and his marked attention
to her charming self. It was not in
human nature, Mrs. Hale argued, that a young
and penniless girl would refuse a wealthy young
man, especially not in favor of a man of John
Hale’s age. It was absurd of Joe Richards to insinuate
that her brother-in-law might have supplanted
Austin in Polly’s affections. Having
once gotten an idea in her head no power on earth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>could dislodge it, and Mrs. Hale, to prove her
viewpoint, had decided to investigate the mystery
of Austin’s death to her own satisfaction. Mrs.
Hale thought over Polly’s conduct for several
minutes, then changed her tactics.</p>

<p>“Had you heard recently from Austin?” she
asked, and at the direct question Polly changed
color.</p>

<p>“Not since this letter to you,” she replied
calmly and Mrs. Hale, intent on framing her next
question, failed to analyze her answer.</p>

<p>“Did he make any reference to coming to
Washington?”</p>

<p>“Only in a general way,” and before Mrs.
Hale could question her further, she added, “His
letter of ten days ago said that he might be here
in April.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Mrs. Hale felt that she had scored a
point. “That goes to prove that Austin’s trip
here Tuesday was unexpected.”</p>

<p>“So unexpected that he never even wired you,”
supplemented Polly, and Mrs. Hale eyed her
sharply.</p>

<p>“True,” she replied. “It must have been
something frightfully urgent that brought him
here&mdash;to his death.”</p>

<p>Polly shivered slightly and laid down the letter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>
<p>“When did Austin mail this letter to you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Polly glanced at her in surprise. “Was there
no postmark on the envelope?”</p>

<p>“There was no envelope.”</p>

<p>“What!” Polly half rose then dropped back
in her seat. “No envelope? Then how did you
get the letter?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale looked carefully around to make
sure that no one had entered the boudoir or was
within earshot. Her next remark ignored Polly’s
question.</p>

<p>“I have not shown Austin’s letter to my husband,”
she began. “Mr. Hale does not always
view matters from my standpoint, and he might
be displeased at my having mentioned to Austin
that he was disappointed in Judith’s choice of a
husband. Therefore, Polly, you will say nothing
to him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” agreed Polly. “But about
the letter&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nor mention the letter to Judith,” pursued
Mrs. Hale, paying no attention to Polly’s attempt
to question her. “I shall not discuss it with
Judith, for she might readily resent my writing
Austin to find out something about her husband’s
career before he entered the army in 1917. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>letter”&mdash;Mrs. Hale picked it up, refolded it, and
replaced it in her purse&mdash;“must remain a secret
between you and me.”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Hale,”&mdash;Polly stopped her as she
was about to rise&mdash;“where did you get the letter
and who tore off the last sheet?”</p>

<p>“It is for us to find out who tore it off and
what became of it,” declared Mrs. Hale. At last
Polly was roused out of herself, and the older
woman observed with interest the two hectic spots
of color in her cheeks. “And why the sheet was
torn off.”</p>

<p>The opening of the boudoir door caused Polly
to start nervously, a start which, in Mrs. Hale’s
case became a jump, as Richards addressed them
from the doorway.</p>

<p>“Maud is looking for you, Mrs. Hale,” he announced.
“Luncheon is waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, yes; we will come at once.” Mrs.
Hale was conscious of her flurried manner and
her ingratiating smile was a trifle strained as she
faced her handsome son-in-law. “Where is
Judith?”</p>

<p>“She telephoned that she was lunching at the
Army and Navy Club.” Richards gave no sign
that he was aware of Mrs. Hale’s agitation.
“Your husband is waiting for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Run down, Joe, and tell him not to wait for
me.” Mrs. Hale laid her hand on Polly’s shoulder
and gave her a slight push. “Go also, my
dear.”</p>

<p>But Polly hung back. “Wait, Mrs. Hale,” she
whispered feverishly. “There, Major Richards
is downstairs by now. Tell me quickly who gave
you Austin’s letter?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Then where did you get it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale paused and looked carefully around&mdash;they
had the boudoir to themselves, but before
she spoke Mrs. Hale took the precaution to close
the boudoir door.</p>

<p>“I found the letter this morning,” she stated,
“in the leather pocket of Judith’s electric car.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nna</span>, the waitress, found the time lagging
in spite of the game of solitaire
she was playing to wile away the tedium
of her enforced idleness. She cast a resentful
glance at her swollen ankle before shuffling the
cards for the thirtieth time since she had eaten
her midday meal. She had discarded the morning
newspaper, and refused to find entertainment
in the cheap paper novel which the cook had
brought to her early in the morning, so her last
and only solace was the pack of playing cards.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale, a New Yorker by birth, until her
marriage had spent her life in the North, and
while she had quickly succumbed to the spell
which the Capital City casts over those who come
to its hospitable doors, she had never taken kindly
to employing negro servants. She did not understand
the African character, and her one attempt
to adjust herself to the conditions then prevailing
in domestic service in the District of Columbia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>had proved a dismal failure. With her husband’s
hasty approval she had sent to New York
and engaged French and English servants.</p>

<p>Aside from her eccentricities, Mrs. Hale was a
kind and thoughtful mistress, and the servants remained
long in her employ. Even during the
chaotic war-time conditions in Washington, with
the influx of war-workers and deserters from the
domestic field, her servants had loyally remained
with her in preference to seeking Government
“positions” as elevator women and messengers.</p>

<p>It required a person in Anna’s state of mind to
find fault with the large, cozily furnished bedroom
in which she sat. A coal fire on the hearth
added its cheerful glow, and at her elbow was
an electric reading lamp ready for instant service
when the winter afternoon drew to a close.</p>

<p>Anna scowled at her reflection in the mirrored
paneling of the door leading to the bathroom
which she and “cook,” a Swede, shared with
Maud, the parlor maid. For nearly twenty-four
hours she had been kept captive inside the four
walls of her bedroom, and her restless spirit rebelled.
Fate, in the guise of a treacherous high-heeled
slipper, had given her an ugly tumble down
the kitchen stairs on her way to bed the night
before, and Dr. McLane’s assurance that she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>had a lucky escape did not assuage Anna’s sense
of personal grievance nor deaden the pain of her
physical injury.</p>

<p>Footsteps and the clatter of dishes, as a tray
was brought in slight contact with the stair turning,
came distinctly through the open door leading
to the hall. Anna’s downcast look vanished.
Seizing the cards, she was intent on laying out her
favorite solitaire when Maud entered, bearing a
tray loaded with appetizing dishes.</p>

<p>“I’m a bit late,” she explained apologetically,
as Anna swept the playing cards into her lap to
make a place on the table for the tray. “But
there’s been a pile of coming and going in and out
of the house, and it keeps a body moving.”</p>

<p>“Sit down and have a cup of tea with me,”
suggested Anna, on whom the extra cup and
saucer on the tray had not been lost. Maud had
evidently anticipated the invitation, judging also
from the amount of cinnamon toast and thin slices
of bread and butter. “I am sorry, Maud, to have
more work thrown on you just now; perhaps I
can hobble downstairs to-morrow. Dr. McLane
seemed to think I might.”</p>

<p>“Now, you rest easy,” advised Maud earnestly.
“I can handle the work all right, and Mr. Hale
said he would come down handsome for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“He did!” Anna’s eyes had narrowed to thin
slits, but Maud, intent on consuming as much tea
and toast as was humanly possible in a given time,
was oblivious of her facial contortions. “Mr.
Hale is a generous gentleman; you stick by <i>him</i>,
Maud.”</p>

<p>“You bet. What he says goes,” Maud nodded
enthusiastically. “Funny household, ain’t it?
A dead easy one if you are in the ‘know,’” and
she chuckled. “Let me pour you out another
cup, Miss Anna,” and, not waiting for permission,
she replenished Anna’s tea, at the same time
refilling her own cup. “My, don’t cook make
good toast! No wonder Major Richards is so
partial to it.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” Anna’s tone was dry.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, and he’s partial to a good deal
more besides.” Maud relished an opportunity of
airing her views to so superior a person as Anna,
for it was not often that she had her undivided
attention. “Major Richards knows a good-looking
woman when he sees one.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” indifferently, helping herself to
more sugar.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” with emphasis. “Didn’t I see
the look and smile he gave you yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! None of that.” Anna spoke with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>severity. “Major Richards is Miss Judith’s husband,
a nicely spoken gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Sure he is.” Maud smiled broadly, nothing
daunted by Anna’s frown. “And say, ain’t Miss
Judith mashed on him? That cold kind always
flops the worst when they fall in love.”</p>

<p>“Miss Judith isn’t the cold kind,” retorted
Anna warmly. “She has plenty of temper about
her, but I will say it’s tempered with proper
pride.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it was proper pride which made
her quarrel so with Mr. Austin?” Maud’s
snicker always grated on Anna, and again the
waitress frowned. “Say, wasn’t his death
awful?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Anna sat back with a shiver. “Terrible!”</p>

<p>“And they dunno who done it,” pursued Maud
with relish, her somewhat nasal voice slightly
raised. “Leastways that is what Detective
Ferguson told me this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Was he at the house again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, three times.” Maud looked regretfully
at the empty toast dish. “I asked him if he
wanted a bed made up for his convenience, and he
was real peevish. My, but he asks a lot of questions!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“What about?” inquired Anna.</p>

<p>“Oh, where we were on Tuesday night, and
if we heard anything unusual,” answered Maud
with careless candor. “Didn’t seem to believe
that we had all gone to bed the same as usual.
I told him if we’d a known Mr. Austin was to
have been murdered, o’ course we’d have waited
up for it, so as to supply the police with details.
That settled him for a time and then he wanted to
know when I last saw Miss Judith Tuesday
night.”</p>

<p>“So?” Anna leaned out of her chair and
took up a box of candy from the bureau. “Help
yourself, Maud. What did you say to Ferguson?”</p>

<p>Maud received the candy with eyes which
sparkled as Anna put the box conveniently in
front of her. Her craving for sweets had frequently
earned her a reprimand from Mrs. Hale
when that dame caught her in the act of purloining
candy from the stock kept in the dining room.</p>

<p>“I told Ferguson that Miss Judith was undressing
in her bedroom when I went upstairs.”
Maud’s speech was somewhat impeded by a large
caramel. “Then he wanted to know when we
first heard o’ the murder&mdash;silly question, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Very,” agreed Anna. “Considering he came
upstairs and joined us just after Mrs. Hale had
broken the news of Mr. Austin’s death. Men are
silly creatures.”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em are,” amended Maud. “I never
would call Mr. Robert Hale silly. Say, Miss
Anna,”&mdash;and Maud hitched her chair close to
the waitress&mdash;“do you s’pose he knows anything
about the courting that went on between
Miss Polly and his brother?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything that escapes Mr. Hale’s
notice,” Anna responded dryly.</p>

<p>“But Miss Polly was mighty sly about it,”
argued Maud. “Mr. Austin caught her once,
though, and my, didn’t he flare up!” Her eyes
grew bigger at the recollection. “I wonder if he
was smart enough to know Miss Polly, for all her
appearing frankness, was playing father and son
off against each other.”</p>

<p>“Men never know anything where a pretty
woman’s concerned,” replied Anna scornfully.
“Miss Judith knew what was going on though,
and”&mdash;she lowered her voice to confidential
tones&mdash;“it’s my belief that her Uncle John used
his influence with the family to get her sent on
that visit to Japan.”</p>

<p>“And there she met Major Richards.” Maud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>selected another piece of candy. “My, ain’t Fate
funny sometimes!” Her companion agreed, and
Maud munched the milk chocolates with silent enjoyment.
Then her active mind went off on a
tangent as she caught sight of the playing cards
still reposing in a disorderly heap in Anna’s lap.
“Mr. Hale got in one of his tantrums this morning.”</p>

<p>“He did?” Anna put down her cup from
which she had been slowly sipping her strong
black tea. “What about?”</p>

<p>“He said one of his playing cards was missing
from the pack he keeps in the library, and he just
as much as asked me if I had stolen it.” Maud
sniffed. “If he hadn’t been so nice about my
wages and my room wasn’t so comfortable, and
you and cook being so agreeable, I’d a given
notice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Mr. Hale doesn’t mean half he
says,” Anna hastened to smooth down Maud’s
ruffled feelings. “He forgets the cause of his
tantrums ten minutes afterward. What’s the use
of paying attention to them? His wife never
does.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t his wife,” objected Maud. “And he
didn’t forget this tantrum, though it was about
such a measly little thing, but came right back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>after lunch and asked me had I found the card in
any one’s room. He was put out when I told
him no.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad, Maud,” exclaimed Anna, who
had followed her story with gratifying attention.
“Mr. Hale shouldn’t worry you when you have
extra work with me laid up here. Why not speak
to Mrs. Hale?”</p>

<p>“Not me!” broke in Maud hastily. “I ain’t
hankering to start a family ruction. Don’t you
worry, Miss Anna, I fixed it,” Maud smiled slyly.
“I went up to Miss Judith’s boudoir with the C.
&amp; P. man to mend her branch telephone this afternoon,
and I just happened to see a pack o’ playing
cards lying on Major Richards’ dresser; their
backs were just the same as Mr. Hale’s pack in
the library, so I sneaked out the Knave o’ Hearts.
After the telephone man left, I gave the card
to Mr. Hale. And say, what do you s’pose he
did?”</p>

<p>Anna shook her head. “I can’t guess. Do go
on.”</p>

<p>“Well, first he gave that funny giggle o’ his,
then he slips the card in his pocket, and asks me
where I got it.” Maud paused dramatically.
“When I said I found it on Major Richards’
dresser he looked at me kinda funny and”&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>violent sneeze interrupted the recital&mdash;“then he
gave me a raise in wages.”</p>

<p>“Bless me!” Anna ejaculated admiringly.
“That was smart work, Maud.”</p>

<p>Her companion smiled deprecatingly. “’Tain’t
nothing to what I can do when I set my mind to
it,” she replied. “I just happened on Major
Richards’ cards. How’s your ankle?”</p>

<p>The waitress started at the abruptness of the
question.</p>

<p>“It is not so painful,” she said, and glanced
significantly at the clock on the mantel. “Isn’t
it ’most time for you to see about setting the
table for dinner?”</p>

<p>“No; the family’s dining out to-night,” rejoined
Maud, “so that me and cook can rest up.
Mrs. Hale is pretty much of a fool, but she is
considerate of us. There are times,” added Maud
in a burst of confidence, “when I feel darn sorry
for her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let your sympathies get the better of
your judgment,” warned Anna. “Mr. and Mrs.
Hale are&mdash;well, you might say ‘discordantly’
happy.”</p>

<p>Maud wrinkled her brows. “If you are hinting
they like to fuss, you are dead right,” she
acknowledged. “There’s one thing odd I’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>noticed to-day”&mdash;She paused to contemplate herself
in the mirrored door with inward satisfaction;
the simple black dress on her slight, trim
figure and neat white collar and cuffs, which Mrs.
Hale insisted should be worn by her servants, was
becoming.</p>

<p>“What were you noticing to-day?” asked
Anna, growing impatient as the pause became prolonged.</p>

<p>“That Mrs. Hale and Miss Polly Davis were
getting as thick as thieves,” explained Maud. “I
ain’t never seen them so loving.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Anna stroked her cheek reflectively.
“Mrs. Hale feels Miss Judith’s marriage
more than she is willing to allow, I believe,
and she’s just looking ’round to find somebody
to ‘mother.’”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny deal her picking on Miss Polly
for that,” laughed Maud as she arranged the tea
dishes on the tray preparatory to departure.
“D’ye know, as poor as I am, I’d give a month’s
wages to know who had a hand in killing Mr.
Austin.” She paused and placed her lips against
Anna’s right ear. “Them bloody shears Mr.
Ferguson is forever exhibiting never belonged to
Miss Judith,” she whispered, “but Miss Polly’s
are missing from her desk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Down in Robert Hale’s den Polly Davis
stopped transcribing his manuscript notes to stare
at three letters which she spread before her. She
read them in rotation for at least the seventh
time, then settled back in her chair and, resting
her weight on its arms, contemplated the
notes.</p>

<p>The first was but a scrawl:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dearest</span>:</p>

<p>You must dine with me to-night. I will not take
a refusal and will call at the usual hour.</p>

<p class="right2">Your devoted lover,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p></div>

<p>The second letter was from Judith:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do not hesitate to use the enclosed check for your
contemplated trip. Return the loan at your convenience,
and let me know if you should need more.</p>

<p>Ever, dear Polly, faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Judith</span>.</p></div>

<p>“My contemplated trip,” quoted Polly softly.
The haggard lines in her face were accentuated
by the merciless electric light which beat down
from a lamp but a few feet above her typewriter
desk. “Judith, are you mad!”</p>

<p>Slowly her eyes turned to the third note. It
had no commencement other than the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In recognition of your valuable services I am increasing
your salary fifty dollars per month. Please
arrange to give me additional hours daily.</p>

<p class="right2">Yours, etc.,</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THREAT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom</span> their corner table Judith watched,
with total lack of interest, the gay throng
which filled the public dining room at
Rauscher’s, although the scene was one to arrest
attention. The smartly gowned women, the foreign
attachés in their gay uniforms in contrast to
the khaki-clad army officers and the somber evening
dress of numerous civilians, formed an attractive
center for the mirrored walls and shaded
lights. Judith’s inattention was a source of displeasure
to her mother whose efforts to sustain
the conversation had failed.</p>

<p>“Really, Judith,” she remonstrated, “it is
very annoying of you to make me repeat my
remarks.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mother.” Judith awoke
from dreary thoughts. “I did not mean to be
rude, but our&mdash;our mourning”&mdash;glancing down
at her black dress&mdash;“seems so incongruous here.
We should have found a less conspicuous place to
dine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“Tut! you are supersensitive; we must eat and
why not here? We are not giving a dinner.”
Mrs. Hale paused to bow to an acquaintance.
“Robert and your husband went to the club so
that we would not have even an appearance of a
party. Why, there is Frank Latimer. Wave to
him, Judith.”</p>

<p>Not waiting for her suggestion to be followed,
Mrs. Hale signaled vigorously with her fan and
succeeded in catching the eye of the attentive
major-domo who, guessing her meaning, directed
Latimer’s attention to her table. Mrs. Hale
greeted the stockbroker with a cordial smile.</p>

<p>“Join us, Frank,” she exclaimed, as their waitress
placed a chair for him. Latimer cast a
doubtful eye at an adjoining table.</p>

<p>“That is my habitual place,” he explained. “I
dine here every night.”</p>

<p>“Fortunate man, with no domestic problems,”
sighed Mrs. Hale. “Really, Anna could not
have selected a more unfortunate time to fall
downstairs&mdash;or was it upstairs, Judith?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mother.” Judith had changed
color at Latimer’s approach as memory of her
interview in his office, the conversation she had
overheard the night before, and her letter explaining
the bond transaction recurred to her. “Anna
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>is so seldom ill that we can forgive her this once.”
She raised grave eyes to Latimer. “Do dine
with us, Frank.”</p>

<p>Latimer had only opportunity to murmur his
thanks as Mrs. Hale took possession of the situation
and claimed his undivided attention. As the
meal progressed he stole a look now and then at
Judith. Her preoccupation was evident and the
furtive glances she cast about the big dining room
were indicative of her nervous condition. Latimer’s
anxiety grew. Would Mrs. Hale never
give him a chance for a private word with Judith?
After the receipt of her note that morning he had
tried to write an answer, but, after a vain attempt
to crystallize his thoughts into black ink, he had
thrown down his pen and applied to that mixed
blessing, the telephone, only to be told that Judith
was not at home.</p>

<p>If Judith divined his desire to talk with her she
gave no sign of it. Latimer’s anxiety was tinged
with vexation. Was Judith deliberately avoiding
every effort he made to drag her into the conversation?
His hot temper was gaining the upper
hand when Mrs. Hale unconsciously gave him the
opening he had been hoping for.</p>

<p>“How is the stock market?” she asked, and not
waiting for an answer, added, “Did you purchase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>those Liberty Bonds Robert spoke of last week?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Latimer turned determinedly to
Judith. “Your husband sold your Troy Valve
bonds at somewhat of a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale caught the words and looked at her
daughter in open consternation.</p>

<p>“Judith! You haven’t parted with the bonds
your grandfather left you?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Judith tossed down her napkin and
pushed back her chair. “Joe and I decided that
this was the time to invest in Liberty Bonds.”
Her charming smile disarmed criticism. “Besides,
industrials are dangerous investments.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” ejaculated Mrs. Hale with indignant
emphasis. “You know what General
Hale thought of his Valve bonds and how carefully
he portioned them out among us in his will.
Your father will be seriously displeased, Judith.”</p>

<p>“Not when I tell him that the bonds are
already depreciating in value,” responded Judith
quietly. “They are depreciating, Frank, are they
not?” Her emphasis on the verb arrested Latimer’s
attention and quickly he caught his cue.</p>

<p>“Liberty Bonds are a better investment,” he
stated, “especially just now. You”&mdash;he smiled
at Mrs. Hale&mdash;“are putting your money in Liberty
Bonds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Hale was not appeased. “I am not
selling valuable bonds,” she retorted. “The
money I invest in Liberty Bonds is the income
from other sources. What did you realize on
your bonds, Judith?”</p>

<p>Judith’s brow wrinkled in thought, then she
turned to Frank. “I have a poor head for figures,”
she admitted softly. “What did Joe get
for the bonds, Frank?”</p>

<p>Latimer eyed her thoughtfully. “We paid Joe
$1,275, less commission. The bonds bring $125
each.”</p>

<p>“Is that all!” And Mrs. Hale’s eyebrows
rose in displeasure. “What a wretched time to
sell. I shall remonstrate with your husband for
permitting you to part with the bonds.”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the sort.” The girl’s
tone brought a hot flush to her mother’s cheeks,
but there was that in Judith’s expression which
checked her angry rejoinder. “Please, Mother,
remember that I am independent as far as
my fortune is concerned, and am my own mistress.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale considered her for a minute, then to
Latimer’s horror, for he had a shy man’s distaste
of scenes, her lower lip quivered suggestively,
while her pale blue eyes grew moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“What a way to address your mother, Judith,”
she said reproachfully. “I, who have your best
interests at heart. It is most unkind.”</p>

<p>“I had no intention of being unkind.” Judith
laid her hand for a second gently on her mother’s
shoulder. “Only, please do not discuss my affairs
with my husband; he also”&mdash;she looked
squarely at Latimer&mdash;“has my best interests at
heart and I can rely upon his honest judgment.”</p>

<p>Latimer bowed. “Joe is no fool,” he remarked
dryly. “Don’t worry, Mrs. Hale, I
guarantee that Judith is quite right in the stand
she is taking, and”&mdash;again he bowed&mdash;“I admire
her for it.”</p>

<p>“You have always approved of woman suffrage,”
grumbled Mrs. Hale, as she rose and
led the way down the aisle to the entrance to the
dining room. “But take a word of advice from
an older woman, Judith; it is not the wife who
asserts her independence who gains her wishes, it
is she who concedes the little things of life who
controls the big issues. To rule, a woman must
never show she rules.”</p>

<p>She paused to speak a complimentary word to
the major-domo, and Judith, striding ahead down
the short staircase, discovered that Latimer was
keeping step with her. Before he could voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>his thoughts, she had formulated her line of
action.</p>

<p>“If you have any stock deals,” she said in an
undertone, “do tip me off. Hush, not a word; I
don’t wish Mother to know I am playing the
market, here she comes.”</p>

<p>His ideas in a whirl, Latimer assisted them
into their limousine just as a touring car drove
up to the curb and stopped with a grinding of
brakes which echoed down the street. A second
more and John Hale had flung himself out of the
car and dashed over to the limousine. A rapid
survey showed him that the only occupants of the
car were Mrs. Hale and Judith.</p>

<p>“Where have you left Polly?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Left her?” Mrs. Hale’s voice showed her
astonishment. “Nowhere; Polly has not been
with us.”</p>

<p>“Not with you?” Her brother-in-law stared
at her. “Didn’t she dine with you?”</p>

<p>“She did not,” tartly. “What gave you that
impression?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Davis told me that Polly telephoned she
was with you.” Hale turned almost savagely toward
Judith. “Where is she?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.” Judith eyed him in wonderment.
It was not often that she saw him discomposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
in manner. He moved slightly and the
light from the limousine’s lamps showed his features
more clearly. “Surely, Uncle John, you
are not worried about her whereabouts?”</p>

<p>John Hale passed a nervous hand over his chin.
“Polly was to dine with me,” he explained. “I
waited at her home, and finally her mother returned
from dining with a neighbor and gave me
Polly’s message. I remembered you were to dine
here, so chased you up. You are sure you don’t
know where she is?”</p>

<p>“Of course we don’t,” chimed in Mrs. Hale.
“Bless me, John, why worry? Polly is quite old
enough to take care of herself, and she is not
likely to get lost in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Lost? Of course not,” with rough emphasis.
“I have a message for Polly which must be delivered.
Have you any idea where she is dining,
Judith?”</p>

<p>Judith thought a moment before replying.
“Possibly she is with the Wards in Chevy Chase,”
she suggested. “I recall Polly had a telephone
talk with Kate this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” John Hale swung around and
caught Latimer by the shoulder. Until that moment
he had ignored the presence of the little
stockbroker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Drive out to Chevy Chase, Frank,” he urged.
“Come, man, don’t keep me waiting,” and, not
heeding Latimer’s remonstrances, he hurried him
toward his car. Then, as the latter hung back
with the reiterated statement that he had an important
business engagement, he interrupted him
with an oath.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Frank,” John Hale spoke between
clenched teeth. “I’ll explain later; jump in.”
Scarcely waiting for Latimer to do so, he climbed
in behind the wheel and, turning the car up Connecticut
Avenue, he speeded up that thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Latimer rode in perturbed silence, occasionally
stealing a glance at his companion’s set, stern
features. He had followed John Hale in his
college days with doglike fidelity, and the habit
had clung through their years of faithful friendship.
As the car left the city limits behind and
tore along the road leading to the fashionable
suburb of Chevy Chase, Latimer broke the protracted
silence.</p>

<p>“What’s to pay, John?” he asked.</p>

<p>John Hale waited until they had overtaken a
trolley, then slowed down the car’s speed almost to
a crawl.</p>

<p>“God knows!” he responded, and his voice
was not quite steady. “Frank, I&mdash;I’m miserable&mdash;miserable,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
and Frank, after one glance at
his face, forebore to question further.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Hale, from the window of her limousine,
watched John Hale’s abrupt departure with astonishment
not unmixed with resentment.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Judith, your uncle grows
more impossible every day,” she remarked, and,
meeting with no comment from her daughter, she
picked up the speaking tube and called to her
chauffeur, “Home.”</p>

<p>On reaching there, Mrs. Hale changed her mind
with characteristic suddenness.</p>

<p>“I’ll run down to the club and pick up your
father,” she said as she hopped back into the
limousine. “I remember now that he left word
we were to call for him. Won’t you come,
Judith?”</p>

<p>Judith, halfway up the steps leading to the
front door, shook her head.</p>

<p>“No thanks, Mother, I have several letters to
write,” and with a wave of her hand she hurried
inside the house. Maud, who had waited in some
uncertainty until she saw the limousine drive off
with Mrs. Hale seated in it, closed the front door.</p>

<p>“Can I do anything for you, Mrs. Richards?”
she asked, as Judith paused to look at several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>notes lying on the hall table. None was addressed
to her and she laid them back again.</p>

<p>“No, Maud, not a thing,” she replied. “Has
Major Richards returned?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, ma’am.” Maud, catching a furtive
look at herself in the long mirror on the wall, rearranged
her cap to a more becoming angle. “Is
it too early to take your pitcher of ice water to
your boudoir, ma’am? Anna said you had one
generally.”</p>

<p>“It is not too early.” Judith turned toward
the circular staircase. “How is Anna?”</p>

<p>“Much better, ma’am; she practiced walking
around after dinner and got on first rate,”&mdash;Maud
lingered a moment&mdash;“not but what I
warned her to be careful; ’tain’t any use of taking
chances with a banged-up ankle.”</p>

<p>“True,” agreed Judith absently, and, unloosening
her coat, she went upstairs. Instead of going
at once to her boudoir she hurried down the hall
to her father’s den, and as she entered it Polly
Davis looked up from the manuscript she was
copying and stopped her machine.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;here!” Judith halted abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Polly pushed her chair away from the
typewriter. “Why not?” The question was
put with studied insolence and Judith’s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>widened. “I am working on your father’s manuscript.”</p>

<p>“But at this hour&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am working overtime.” Polly flipped a
note in her direction. “Your father here asks
me to give him ‘additional service.’” She smiled
and shrugged her shoulders. “Any objections?”</p>

<p>“Objections? No.” Judith’s manner retained
its old friendliness, and she ignored the
girl’s manifest hostility.</p>

<p>“Then why question my presence here?”</p>

<p>“I do not question your right to be here.”
Judith chose a chair near Polly. “I have just
seen Uncle John&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” as Judith stopped.</p>

<p>“Uncle John was told by your mother that you
were dining with us.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,”&mdash;Polly’s interruption was
curtly spoken, although the words chosen were
politeness itself&mdash;“Mr. Hale was informed that
I was with you.”</p>

<p>“But you were not.”</p>

<p>“In one sense, yes; in another I am with you
while working in this household.” Again Polly
shrugged her shoulders. “Of course I am not
responsible for whatever interpretation you and
he put on my message to my mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Judith regarded her for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“What is your object in splitting straws?” she
inquired. “Wait&mdash;Uncle John understood you
were to dine with him, then thought you were
with us, and he now believes you are with the
Wards in Chevy Chase and is motoring there, and&mdash;on
returning home, I find you here.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle asked me to dine with him,
but I never accepted his invitation,” replied
Polly. “Frankly, I preferred to wait here and
see you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me, Polly, and I would
have remained at home,” exclaimed Judith.
“Have you had any dinner?” with a hasty glance
about in quest of a tray.</p>

<p>“I dined at the Pastry Shop.” Polly leaned
back in her chair and watched Judith. “I asked
for you before I left this afternoon, but you had
not returned from your drive, and so I came back
an hour ago. What was your object in writing
this note?” and leaning forward Polly placed
Judith’s note and check in her lap.</p>

<p>Judith did not touch the papers.</p>

<p>“The note is self-explanatory,” she stated.
“I hope the vacation will restore your health.”</p>

<p>“My health is quite robust, thank you,” dryly.
“Let us have done with camouflage, Judith, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>be honest with each other. What is your object
in wishing to get rid of me?”</p>

<p>“I have no such desire.”</p>

<p>Polly’s lip curled in scorn. “You wish to get
me away from Washington, away from this
house,” she charged. “Why?”</p>

<p>The two girls contemplated each other, but
while Judith was pale, a feverish color heightened
the sparkle in Polly’s over-bright eyes. When
Judith spoke it was with deliberation.</p>

<p>“I suggested that you go on a vacation,” she
said, “for your own good.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Polly’s laugh ended in a sneer.
“Are you quite sure your consideration is not
misdirected?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure.” Judith’s temper was gaining
the upper hand in spite of her endeavor to keep it
under control. “Once before you ignored my
advice; you know with what results.” She
paused. “Austin’s death&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” Polly leaned forward, both hands
on the arms of her chair.</p>

<p>Instead of completing her sentence Judith
placed the note and her check on Polly’s typewriter.</p>

<p>“You had better arrange to leave to-morrow,”
she said softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t.” Polly’s voice rang out clearly.
“I don’t know whom you are trying to shield, but
you shan’t drive me away&mdash;you shan’t&mdash;you
shan’t!”</p>

<p>“Polly,”&mdash;Judith’s manner compelled the hysterical
girl to gain some hold on the remnant of
her self-control&mdash;“you have forced this scene; I
have tried to avoid it by supplying you with a
way out.” She pointed to the check. “I was
the first person to find Austin’s body&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah! You admit it.” Polly’s voice rose almost
to a scream. “Why haven’t you told that
to the police?”</p>

<p>“Because of my desire to shield you,” Judith
stated calmly.</p>

<p>“To shield me!” Polly half rose, resting her
weight on the arms of her chair.</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Judith stood up and pulled her
coat about her shoulders. “In addition to my
silence, I took from Austin’s body a trinket&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on”&mdash;Polly watched her fascinated,
as she took a step toward the door.</p>

<p>“Your conduct to-night forces me to use a
threat.” Judith spoke in a monotone and slowly
the color ebbed from Polly’s cheeks. “Unless
you leave Washington within twenty-four hours,
I shall give the trinket to the police.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“What&mdash;” Polly moistened her parched lips.
“What is the trinket?”</p>

<p>“A Mizpah locket. Good-night,” and without
a backward glance Judith hurried away.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THEFT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>udith</span> had not inherited her mother’s
fondness for being waited upon and therefore
she had never employed a personal
maid. After her interview with Polly she went
immediately to her bedroom and it required but a
brief time to put away her coat and scarf. In
removing the latter from around her neck, its
delicate mesh caught in the diamond horseshoe
pin, her only ornament, which she wore in the
front of her evening dress. In striving to free
the scarf she discovered to her dismay that one
of the diamonds was missing from the horseshoe.</p>

<p>The pin had been her husband’s wedding gift.
Throwing down the scarf, Judith bent anxiously
and peered at the carpet, but it was difficult to see
so small an object against its soft coloring.
Dropping to her knees, she felt about until her
fingers touched a hard substance. A look at it
disclosed the missing diamond, and with an exclamation
of pleasure and relief Judith rose,
folded the stone in a piece of tissue paper and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>placed it with the diamond pin in her jewelry box.
In doing so she caught sight of a gold locket
safely ensconced in the bottom of the box under
several bracelets and chains. Judith considered
the locket gravely, then closed and locked the
jewelry box just as her name was called in the
boudoir. With heightened color, she hastened
across the bedroom and joined her husband.</p>

<p>“I did not hear you enter, Joe,” she exclaimed
as he held out both hands to her. “How does it
happen that you returned so early? I thought
you planned to run in and see Dr. McLane about
that troublesome cough of yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can wait until morning,” lightly.
“I came back to be with you.” He placed a
morris chair for her before the hearth, where a
coal fire burned fitfully, and perched himself on
the chair’s broad mahogany arm. “I haven’t
seen you alone to-day.” His voice was tinged
with reproach.</p>

<p>Judith slipped a hand inside his. “I did not
mean to neglect you,” she said. “But Mother
and certain business matters claimed a lot of attention.
Why,”&mdash;turning her head as it rested
against the cushion of the high-backed chair&mdash;“why
did you volunteer to dine with Father at
the club and not come with us to Rauscher’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“It was your mother’s plan, not mine.” Richard
laughed softly. “My first impressions of
your mother have radically changed.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“I thought her all fuss and feathers, but underneath
it she has a will of iron.” Richards’ smile
grew rueful. “Does your father ever oppose her
wishes?”</p>

<p>It was Judith’s turn to smile. “Not if he can
help it,” she admitted. “Father is something of
a diplomat as far as Mother is concerned. Perhaps
you have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Richards stared into the fire; he had
become grave. “Somehow, dearest, I do not believe
your father likes me. Oh, he’s been polite
enough,”&mdash;as she was about to speak&mdash;“but
there is something in his manner,&mdash;well,”&mdash;with
another rueful smile&mdash;“it couldn’t by any stretch
of the imagination be termed cordial at any time,
and lately”&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;“the dislike is more
apparent.”</p>

<p>Judith’s pretty color, which had come when she
found him waiting for her in the boudoir, had
waned. “Lately?” she queried. “Do you
mean within the last few days?”</p>

<p>“Yes; to be exact, since Austin’s Hale’s mur&mdash;death,”
he caught himself up. “Don’t mind, darling,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
observing the shadows which had gathered
in her eyes. “I am sorry I mentioned the subject.
Your father, like the rest of us, is upset
by the tragedy&mdash;we will all return to normal
when the mystery is solved.”</p>

<p>“When?” Judith contemplated her well-fitting
suède slipper and the embroidered silk stockings
just peeping beneath her skirt. “Have the
police advanced any new theories?”</p>

<p>“Only that the crime was premeditated.”</p>

<p>Judith looked up. “Premeditated? Then
some one must have known of Austin’s plans to
come here Tuesday night.” She drew in her
breath sharply. “Some bitter enemy.” She
again looked directly up at Richards and found
him gazing in the fire. “What is your theory?”</p>

<p>“My theory? I hardly knew&mdash;know anything
of Austin, therefore it is difficult for me to
form a theory.” Judith took silent note of his
quickly covered confusion, and her hand, still
resting in his, moved uneasily. “Was Austin the
type of man to have an implacable enemy?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no,” Judith drawled out the word.
“He sometimes had a nasty way of speaking,
which used to annoy Uncle John; but he was generally
very agreeable, and some people found him
fascinating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Meaning women?” Judith did not reply at
once, and Richards’ eyes narrowed. “You think
that Austin was killed on impulse?”</p>

<p>“So it appears to me,” she confessed and suppressed
a shudder.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then Richards roused
himself. “I agree with you,” he said. “The
nature of the weapon used proves that.”</p>

<p>“The shears?” Judith glanced up and then
looked quickly away. “You think Austin was
stabbed with the shears?”</p>

<p>“Evidently, for there was no other weapon.”</p>

<p>“No other weapon has been found,” Judith
corrected him softly. “The murderer may have
carried it off with him.”</p>

<p>“True,” acknowledged Richards, “but then
how came the shears to have blood on them? For
what purpose were they used?”</p>

<p>Judith’s breathing seemed suspended for an
infinitesimal second, and several minutes elapsed
before she spoke.</p>

<p>“I am not good at solving problems.” She
twirled his seal ring, which she had given him,
about on his finger. “Have you heard Uncle
John’s theory that Austin was killed by a burglar?”</p>

<p>Richards regarded her fixedly for a minute.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>“Is that so!” he exclaimed. “And what leads
him to suspect a burglar?”</p>

<p>“Austin’s gold watch is missing.” Judith felt
his arm slip down about her shoulders, and his
weight rested against the cushioned back of her
chair. “Also, Father found some papers missing
from his safe.”</p>

<p>“He did&mdash;when?” The question shot from
Richards.</p>

<p>“Sometime Thursday. I don’t know exactly
when.” Judith caught his intent gaze, and while
her heart beat a bit more rapidly, she continued
to look directly at him.</p>

<p>“Has he notified the police?”</p>

<p>“I presume so. He was talking to Detective
Ferguson yesterday just before dinner.”
Judith’s voice sounded a trifle strained in her
own ears, but apparently Richards took no notice.
His gaze had shifted again to the fireplace.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Hale first examined the safe he
declared that its contents were intact,” he remarked.
“Your news is surprising, Judith. It
may be that poor Austin found a burglar rifling
the safe and was killed by him&mdash;it is a reasonable
hypothesis in the light of your father’s discovery.
You said something else was missing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Austin’s watch. It was a valuable heirloom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
inherited from his grandfather, and he always
carried it with him. The watch has not
been found either on his body or in his room.”</p>

<p>“But, Judith, it may be among his effects in
New York,” Richards suggested. “Your mother
told me that he had quarters at the Yale Club and
kept a trunk there.”</p>

<p>Judith shook her head. “Uncle John talked
to the steward of the club on the long distance
telephone, and a search was made, but the watch
could not be found.” Abruptly she changed the
subject. “Will you please hand me a glass of
water, Joe?”</p>

<p>Richards had started for the door when she
called him back. “Don’t go downstairs, the ice
water is here,” she looked about the boudoir.
“There, Maud put it over by the bedroom door.”</p>

<p>Richards filled a glass for her and replacing
it a moment later on the table, he poured out a
glass for himself and almost gulped it down.
Crossing the room, he again seated himself on the
arm of Judith’s chair.</p>

<p>“Judith,” he began, “a strange thing happened
to-day and I want to tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” she prompted gently, as he paused.
“Go on.”</p>

<p>But Richards evidently found some difficulty in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>continuing, for several seconds elapsed before he
spoke again.</p>

<p>“The treasurer of the Metropolis Bank called
me up this afternoon and asked me to stop in and
see him,” he went on. “And when I reached
the bank I was informed that ten thousand dollars
had been placed to my credit.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” Judith clapped her hands.
“Why, Joe!”</p>

<p>“Exactly&mdash;<i>why</i>?” dryly. “Why should
any one do such a thing? I have no near relatives,
no one under obligation to me, and so I told
the bank treasurer, but he refused to disclose the
donor’s name or by whose authority the bank had
acted. He did assure me that it was perfectly
proper for me to use the money, stating that it
was a gift without a string tied to it and that the
money is legally mine.”</p>

<p>“But that is splendid!” exclaimed Judith.
“Are you not elated?”</p>

<p>“No, only puzzled,” Richards admitted slowly.
“I have racked my brain, Judith, to find out
where that money could have come from, and”&mdash;he
held her close to him, his eyes scanning her
face. “Did <i>you</i> give it to me?”</p>

<p>Slowly her eyes fell before his ardent look
and a telltale blush mantled her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured, and for a second clung
to him, then pushed him gently from her.
Suddenly he raised her hands and kissed them
passionately.</p>

<p>“Judith,”&mdash;he steadied his voice before continuing&mdash;“I
can never thank you, never. Therefore
it is all the harder to tell you that I cannot
take your money.”</p>

<p>“But you must!” she exclaimed in alarm.
“Dear, I am wealthy in my own right and this
money is some I had lying idle in a savings bank.
It is no sacrifice for me to give it to you.”</p>

<p>“I would like to think that it is,” he murmured
wistfully. “Tell me, dearest, what put it into
your head to make me so generous a present?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;eh&mdash;” Judith’s native honesty would
not permit an evasion. “I heard that you had
met with reverses in business, Joe.”</p>

<p>Richards looked at her long and intently.
“You heard?” he repeated. “Where?”</p>

<p>Judith raised a protesting finger. “‘Ask me
no questions&mdash;’” she quoted, “you know the old
saw, Joe”; and before he had time to frame another
question, she asked reproachfully. “Why
did you not come to me at once, Joe? I would
gladly have helped.”</p>

<p>A dull red flush mounted almost to Richards’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>forehead and he averted his eyes from her steady
gaze.</p>

<p>“I can’t borrow from a woman, Judith&mdash;even
the very best and dearest woman in the world,”
he confessed. “Keep your money, sweetheart.
My financial embarrassment was only temporary,
but”&mdash;his voice deepened with emotion&mdash;“I
prize your loyalty above all earthly things.
Judith, I shall strive to be worthy of you,” and
dropping on one knee he kissed her hand with
fervor.</p>

<p>Judith saw his shapely head and fine features
through a mist of tears. Her faith in him should
stand all tests. In spite of what she had learned
of the stolen bonds, he must be innocent&mdash;he
was worthy of her trust, her love. Impulsively
she leaned nearer and he caught her in passionate
embrace.</p>

<p>The clock had ticked away fully an hour when
Judith awoke to the time.</p>

<p>“It is almost midnight,” she exclaimed reproachfully
and rose in haste. As she walked
across the boudoir her attention was attracted by
a package of addressed and stamped envelopes.
“Oh, I forgot to give these to Maud to mail first
thing in the morning, and they are important.”</p>

<p>“Let me have them.” Richards snatched them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>up. “There is a post box in front of the house;
I’ll be right back.” And he hastened down the
hall to the circular staircase.</p>

<p>Not waiting to lower any of the lights, Judith
went into her bedroom and started to undress.
It took but a moment to slip on her wrapper, and
she was about to comb her hair when the disorderly
appearance of her dressing table startled
her. Her toilet articles were tossed hither and
yon.</p>

<p>Judith’s hand sought her jewelry box; the key
was already turned in the lock. Tossing back
the lid, she gazed inside&mdash;the box was empty.</p>

<p>A half-strangled cry escaped from her white
lips and Richards heard it as he entered the
boudoir; a second more and he was by her side.</p>

<p>“See&mdash;my jewels&mdash;they are gone,” she
gasped. “Your horseshoe, even, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Hush, my darling, I’ll find it or get you another.”
Alarmed by her pallor, he picked up a
bottle of smelling salts which stood on the dressing
table and held it open before her. “I will
replace the jewelry.”</p>

<p>“You can’t replace the locket.”</p>

<p>“The locket!” Richards changed color.
“Have you lost the locket?”</p>

<p>In her agitation she failed to catch his question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“My jewelry was here, every piece, and the
locket, when I went in to speak to you, Joe,”
she declared. “I added the horseshoe just before
you called me.”</p>

<p>Richards gazed at her in dumfounded silence.
“What is that?” he asked. “You left your
jewelry in that box when you came in to talk to
me in the boudoir a little while ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I can swear to it.”</p>

<p>Richards sped to the closet door and flung it
open. Only wearing apparel rewarded his search.
A glance at the windows showed that they were
closed and locked on the inside, the bathroom and
dressing room beyond were empty! Convinced
of that, he turned back to Judith who had sunk
into the chair before the dressing table.</p>

<p>“Was any one with you in this room?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, I was alone.” Judith passed her hand
dazedly before her eyes, then again inspected the
empty box. “Every piece of jewelry is gone,”
she stated, “and the box was full two hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Judith?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain&mdash;the jewelry was stolen
within the last two hours.”</p>

<p>Richards looked first at her and then at the
empty box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“How can that be?” he asked. “There is
no entrance to this bedroom except through the
boudoir&mdash;and you and I, Judith, have been in the
boudoir for the past two hours.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>etective Ferguson</span> completed
his tour of the suite of three rooms
and bath which Judith and her husband
occupied and took up his station in the boudoir.
At Richards’ earnest solicitation she had notified
Police Headquarters of the robbery and Ferguson
had been detailed to investigate it. He was followed
into the room an instant later by Judith
who watched him inspect her empty jewelry box
with the aid of a magnifying glass. Quickly he
made his test for finger prints, but she judged
from the negative shake of his head and his
puzzled frown that the results were barren.</p>

<p>“About what hour did the robbery occur last
night?”</p>

<p>Judith started at the abrupt question, for Ferguson,
recalling her deafness and forgetful of the
cleverly concealed earphone which she wore continually,
raised his voice almost to a bellow.</p>

<p>“It must have been between half-past nine
and half-past eleven last night,” she answered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>“You need not speak so loudly, Mr. Ferguson; I
can hear quite well if you use your ordinary
tone.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, I’m sure,” and Ferguson sunk
his voice to its normal pitch. “When did you
last see your jewelry?”</p>

<p>“Just after taking off my wraps upon my return
from dining at Rauscher’s,” Judith explained,
“I opened the box to put away the
diamond horseshoe pin which I had been
wearing.”</p>

<p>“And your other jewelry was then in the
box?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where were you between half-past nine and
half-past eleven?”</p>

<p>“Here, in this boudoir.”</p>

<p>“Any one with you?”</p>

<p>“My husband, Major Richards.”</p>

<p>“Any one else?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Ferguson blinked at her solemnly for a minute,
then rising, stepped to the bedroom door and
glanced inside.</p>

<p>“This is the only entrance to your bedroom,”
he remarked, turning to the silent girl. “How
could a thief enter your room while you and your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>husband were here, and you remain unaware of
it?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know.” Judith shook her
head in bewilderment. “I lay awake nearly all
night puzzling over the enigma.”</p>

<p>Ferguson surveyed the boudoir from every
angle before again addressing her.</p>

<p>“Where were you sitting?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Judith crossed the boudoir toward the fireplace
and wheeled the morris chair forward until it
stood in the exact spot of the night before.</p>

<p>“I sat here,” she explained, “and my husband
was perched on the chair arm.”</p>

<p>Ferguson walked over and sat down in the
chair.</p>

<p>“I presume you and Major Richards were absorbed
in conversation,” he grumbled, and not
giving her an opportunity to answer, continued,
“But you both had a good view of the boudoir
door leading into the hall, through which every
one has to enter. Any one entering last night
would have had to come directly in your line of
vision. Was the door open or closed?”</p>

<p>“Open.”</p>

<p>“All the way open?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“The door stood just as it is now,” declared
Judith, after studying it a moment. A look outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
convinced Ferguson that a person in the hall
would be unable to see what was transpiring in
the boudoir at the angle at which the door stood
ajar.</p>

<p>“A person could enter without having to push
it farther open,” he announced. “Does the door
squeak?” Springing to his feet he answered his
own question by moving the door to and fro.
“Nary a squeak,” he commented, and drawing
out his memorandum book sat down near Judith.
“Now, madam, was it your custom to keep the
jewelry box on your dressing table?”</p>

<p>“When I was in my bedroom or in here, yes,”
replied Judith. “At other times I kept it in the
drawer of my bureau.”</p>

<p>“Was the key in the lock of the box?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Observing his smile, Judith frowned.
“I do not usually leave the key in the lock, but
my husband called to me and I joined him here,
leaving the box standing on my dressing table.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Ferguson stared reflectively at her
for a few seconds. “Ever had anything stolen
before?”</p>

<p>“Never any jewelry,” Judith spoke with unusual
rapidity. “Nor any money,” she added.</p>

<p>Ferguson pursed his lips and tapped them with
his pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Odd!” he exclaimed. “Were the servants
aware that you had this jewelry box?”</p>

<p>“They may have been, for while I do not have
a personal maid, Anna, the waitress, and Maud
sometimes assist me in dressing for evening entertainments.”
Judith wondered when Ferguson
would go. She desired most heartily to be alone
and thresh out her problems by herself. “It is
probable that both the girls have seen the jewelry
box on my dressing table,” she added after a
brief pause.</p>

<p>“Where were the servants last night?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“Anna was in her bedroom suffering from a
sprained ankle”&mdash;Judith’s foot was keeping up
an incessant tattoo. “Maud let me in; after that
I did not see her again. They have both been
here for years and are excellent servants&mdash;they
are English.”</p>

<p>Ferguson made a slight grimace. “That Maud
is a nice she-devil,” he exclaimed below his breath;
Maud’s scathing remarks about the inefficiency of
the detective force in general and Ferguson in
particular still rankled. “I’d like to”&mdash;he
checked himself and again addressed Judith.</p>

<p>“How much approximately was your jewelry
worth, Mrs. Richards?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Judith took a paper from her mesh bag.

“Here is a list of the articles in the jewelry box,”
she explained. “Major Richards suggested that
I prepare it for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine.” Ferguson reached eagerly for
the paper and scanned the items with increasing
interest. “I see you estimate the jewelry at four
thousand five hundred dollars,” he remarked. “A
pretty haul for any thief. Fortunately your
initials are on every piece,” running his eye down
the list in which Judith had inserted a minute
description of the jewelry. “Hold on, here’s one
item, a locket&mdash;with nothing checked against it&mdash;has
the locket any distinguishing mark?”</p>

<p>Footsteps behind Judith caused her to whirl
around, and she saw Richards stop behind her
chair.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get away any sooner,” he explained.
“Your mother detained me in the dining room.
Good-morning, Ferguson; has my wife told you of
the disappearance of her jewelry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Major, and I was just asking her for
details to aid in identifying it at the pawn shops,”
Ferguson again referred to the list he was holding.
“What about that locket, Mrs. Richards?”</p>

<p>Judith closed her mesh bag with a snap and the
quick tilt upward of her chin indicated to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>Richards, who had grown to know each mood and
tense, that she had reached a sudden decision.</p>

<p>“The locket bore the word ‘Mizpah,’ in
raised lettering,” she stated. “Otherwise it is
insignificant in appearance.”</p>

<p>“Do you attach any particular value to it?”
questioned Ferguson.</p>

<p>“No money value,” she responded quietly, and
the detective looked sharply at her.</p>

<p>“I see; you mean it is a trinket of importance
from sentiment only,” he commented.</p>

<p>It was Major Richards who answered and not
his wife. “You’ve hit it,” he laughed. “I presume
Mrs. Richards values the locket more highly
than rubies.”</p>

<p>Judith looked at him oddly before turning to the
detective. “I have a request to make of you,
Mr. Ferguson,” she began, without preface. “It
is that you make no mention of the loss of my
jewelry to any one. I am convinced that if we
conduct the search in secrecy, the thief will betray
himself.”</p>

<p>Ferguson stroked his cheek thoughtfully. “I
don’t like the idea,” he objected. “I am a believer
in publicity myself.”</p>

<p>“You have had plenty of publicity in the
Austin Hale case,” Richards pointed out dryly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>“I cannot see that it has advanced you very
far.”</p>

<p>Ferguson reddened. “We haven’t told the
public all we know,” he admitted. “There are a
few cards up our sleeve.”</p>

<p>“For instance?” and Richards’ smile was
tantalizing.</p>

<p>“As to the nature of Hale’s wound”&mdash;the
detective paused abruptly&mdash;“but that will come
out in the medical evidence at the inquest.”</p>

<p>“And when will the inquest be held?” demanded
Richards.</p>

<p>“When we lay our hands on a material witness
necessary before we can present the case,” Ferguson
spoke with provoking slowness. “You will
learn all the facts in good time, Major; at present
certain clews cannot be divulged.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were an advocate of publicity,”
Richards remarked, and again Ferguson flushed.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” he acknowledged with a
show of good nature. “All right, Mrs. Richards,
I’ll conduct this investigation as quietly as possible.
But how are you going to prevent your
family’s knowing that you have lost your jewelry?
Won’t they comment when you don’t wear
it?”</p>

<p>“If they do I shall say that I have put it in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>my safe deposit box,” was Judith’s ready response.
“My father has frequently urged me to
do so in the past and with Austin’s death and the
theft of his watch, what’s more likely than that
I should place my jewelry in a safe place?”</p>

<p>Ferguson nodded his approval. “That is a
wise argument,” he said. “No one can dispute
it. Now, about Mr. Hale’s watch,”&mdash;he turned
back the pages of his memorandum book until he
came to a certain entry&mdash;“can you describe it?”</p>

<p>“In a general way,” Judith spoke with some
hesitation. “I have seen the watch often, but I
am not very observant.”</p>

<p>Ferguson considered her for some seconds in
silence. He disagreed with her statement&mdash;Judith,
in his opinion, was not the heedless type;
her detailed description of her jewelry, safely
tucked away in his pocket, proved that.</p>

<p>“What was the watch like, Mrs. Richards?”
he asked for the second time.</p>

<p>“It was an antique, made before the Revolution,
so family tradition has it,” she stated, “an
open-faced watch, wound with a key and the dial
has an American eagle beautifully etched upon
it.”</p>

<p>Ferguson took down her words, closed his notebook
and rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“I am greatly obliged,” he said. “It should
not be difficult to trace young Hale’s watch and
also your jewelry if the thief tries to dispose of
it. But that,” he stared at her, “presupposes it
was the work of an ordinary thief.”</p>

<p>“And what leads you to think otherwise?”
asked Judith swiftly.</p>

<p>Ferguson took several steps toward the door
and hesitated in some uncertainty. “Your jewelry
was stolen by some one familiar with your
habits and familiar with the arrangement of these
rooms,” he stated gravely. “There is no possible
way of entering your bedroom save through this
boudoir, as all your windows were found locked
on the inside. How the thief stole by you and
your husband unobserved while you sat here, we
have yet to discover. But, take it from me, the
thief was a member of this household. Good-morning.”
Not pausing for reply, the detective
vanished.</p>

<p>“A member of this household,” repeated
Richards thoughtfully. “Judith, have you no
suspicion&mdash;no clew?” and his eyes searched her
face anxiously.</p>

<p>Judith leaned back in her chair and gradually
her tense muscles relaxed.</p>

<p>“I have no clew,” she replied. “But&mdash;tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>me, when you got that glass of water for me,
did you glance at all into our bedroom?”</p>

<p>Richards pressed down the tobacco in his pipe
and hunted through his pockets for a match.</p>

<p>“Did I look into our bedroom?” he asked.
“I may have looked, but I can’t swear to it.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span> door</span> slammed and hasty footsteps
sounded down the corridor, then a
figure blocked the doorway to the sitting
room of Latimer’s bachelor apartment.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!”</p>

<p>Latimer dropped the Sunday newspaper he had
been reading and stared at John Hale. For a
moment he had not recognized his friend’s voice&mdash;it
was hoarse, discordant.</p>

<p>“She&mdash;who?” he exclaimed, springing to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Polly.” John Hale swayed slightly, then
lunged for the nearest chair and dropped into it.
Latimer wasted no words, but poured out a liberal
pony of brandy and placed it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Feel better?” he asked, watching the color
steal back into John Hale’s white cheeks as he
put the empty brandy glass on the mantel. Not
receiving an answer to his query, he busied himself
about the room which served as library and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>office. A colored factotum who “went with the
apartment” served his breakfasts; the other meals
Latimer took at his club or at Rauscher’s. His
two rooms, bath, and kitchenette were unusually
large, owing to the building having been, before
the World War, a private residence. The architect,
in remodeling it, had been generous in his
allotment of space.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes John Hale pulled
himself together and signed to Latimer to draw
up a chair.</p>

<p>“Sorry I made such a fool of myself,” he began,
“but I’m hard hit.”</p>

<p>Latimer looked at him in distress. “What is
wrong?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Polly’s gone.”</p>

<p>“So you stated before. Where has she gone?”</p>

<p>“I can’t find out.” John Hale drummed his
fingers nervously up and down his walking stick
to which he still clung. “You know I called up
Mrs. Davis after our fruitless trip to Chevy Chase.
She said Polly had come in and gone to bed.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was pretty late when we got back,”
Latimer pointed out.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks to that traffic cop.” John Hale
frowned angrily. “I’d have seen Polly if he
hadn’t insisted on taking us to the police station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Your previous record for speeding was
against you, John,” remarked Latimer mildly.
“But what about Polly?”</p>

<p>“This morning I ran over to see her; found
her mother in tears, and a trained nurse looking
after her and&mdash;” John Hale stopped and pulled
out a crumpled note&mdash;“here, read for yourself,”
and tossed it to him.</p>

<p>Latimer scanned the few lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:</p>

<p>Nurse Phelps will spend a few days with you in
my absence. Have run off for that promised change.
Don’t worry, darling.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Polly.</span></p></div>

<p>“Well?” he asked as he returned the note.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Davis told me that she had wished
Polly to take a vacation for some time and visit
their cousin, Mrs. Paul Davis, at Markham, Virginia.
She believed Polly had gone there.”
John Hale paused. “I’ve just talked with Mrs.
Paul Davis on the long distance telephone.
Polly is not with her, and not expected.”</p>

<p>Latimer regarded John Hale in bewilderment.
“Then where has she gone?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I have no idea.” Again John Hale played
with his walking stick.</p>

<p>Latimer considered him gravely. “What am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>I to infer?” he asked. “That Polly has disappeared?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But, my heavens, man! Why?”</p>

<p>John Hale shifted his walking stick from one
hand to the other. “Overwork,” he said briefly;
“unbalanced.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Again Latimer considered
him. “Polly did not look ill.”</p>

<p>“But she was,” fiercely. “Any fool could
have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly so,” agreed Latimer quietly. “I
haven’t seen Polly as frequently as you or
Austin.”</p>

<p>John Hale’s strong white teeth snapped viciously
at his under lip.</p>

<p>“Leave Austin’s name out of it”&mdash;his manner
was dictatorial in the extreme and Latimer
flushed.</p>

<p>“I will, with pleasure, but”&mdash;he hesitated,
then disregarding John Hale’s glare, continued
steadily&mdash;“are you quite sure that Austin’s
tragic death has not had something to do with
Polly’s&mdash;as you claim&mdash;mental condition?”</p>

<p>John Hale compressed his lips ominously.
“No,” he declared. “Get such an idea out of
your head at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t,” Latimer confessed frankly. “Austin
and Polly were engaged.”</p>

<p>“Were? Quite so.” John Hale’s laugh was
mirthless. “The engagement was broken by
Polly before his death.”</p>

<p>“How soon before his death?”</p>

<p>“Damn! What business is it of yours?”
John Hale turned on him savagely.</p>

<p>Latimer rose. “None of my business&mdash;now,”
he said. “You were the first to bring up
the discussion. You are of course at liberty to
express your views; I reserve the right to hold
my own opinion. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Here, wait&mdash;” John Hale pushed Latimer
back in his chair. “I spoke hastily&mdash;without
thought&mdash;and I apologize. I’m a bit unhinged.”</p>

<p>Latimer regarded him with concern.</p>

<p>“Have you had any breakfast?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;coffee and rolls; all I wanted,”
John Hale moved restlessly. “I must find
Polly.”</p>

<p>“Have you reported her disappearance to the
police?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not; we must have no scandal,”
John Hale frowned. “You and I must find
Polly.”</p>

<p>“Willingly&mdash;but how are we to go about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“For one thing, you can call on Mrs. Davis
under pretense of wishing to engage Polly as your
stenographer, and she will probably give you her
present address. You may get more out of her
than I did. Frankly,”&mdash;John Hale gave an embarrassed
laugh&mdash;“Mrs. Davis’ manner to me
has been very peculiar lately. To-day she appeared
almost to resent my questions regarding
Polly’s whereabouts.”</p>

<p>Latimer whistled. “So!” he exclaimed.
“She may be aiding Polly to avoid you.”</p>

<p>“That hadn’t occurred to me,” John Hale admitted.
“But why? She knows I am Polly’s
best friend.”</p>

<p>Latimer took out his cigarette case and offered
it to his companion. With his left hand he indicated
the box of matches on the smoking stand at
Hale’s elbow.</p>

<p>“Have you and Polly quarreled?” he asked.</p>

<p>It took a few seconds for John Hale to light
his cigarette. “No,” he said between puffs.
Then, removing his cigarette, he looked straight
at Latimer. “Polly is everything to me,” he
stated solemnly. “I will never give her up. She
shall be my wife,” and his clenched fist struck
the arm of his chair a resounding blow. “Austin,
dead or alive, shall not come between us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Latimer looked at him and then away. In the
glance he had detected a glimpse of the man he
had never seen before&mdash;he had never suspected.
In that instant a naked soul had been bared in all
its human frailties.</p>

<p>“Austin has always been a disappointment to
me,” John Hale continued&mdash;he spoke almost as
if communing with himself and forgetful of
Latimer’s presence. “For his mother’s sake I
condoned his wild habits while at college, his
affairs with women,”&mdash;his voice rasped through
the room&mdash;“then he dared to play fast and loose
with Polly.”</p>

<p>“He did?” Latimer looked up, startled.
“Good Lord, you don’t suppose&mdash;?” he winced
under John Hale’s iron grip and stopped speaking.</p>

<p>“I suppose nothing,” John Hale spoke with
fierce intentness. “Austin had enemies, but
Polly was not one of them&mdash;she had taken his
measure and ceased to care.”</p>

<p>Latimer broke the ensuing silence.</p>

<p>“Then why has Polly bolted?” he asked.</p>

<p>John Hale winced and tapped his cane against
his shoe.</p>

<p>“Polly is ill from overwork,” he insisted
doggedly. “Come, we are wasting time. Suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
I run you down to Polly’s house and you can
question Mrs. Davis. You are not busy, are
you?” with a quick look about the room.</p>

<p>“No; I’ll be with you in a minute,” and
Latimer, true to his word, kept him waiting only
long enough to get his overcoat and hat.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Latimer was mounting
the high steps of the old-fashioned mansion on
C Street where Polly and her mother eked out a
small and steadily shrinking income by taking
“paying guests,” a profitable business during the
World War, but one that had grown less so with
the departure of the army of war-workers who
had transformed Washington from a city of
leisure into one of volcanic activity and unpleasant
congestion. It was not until Latimer’s patience
had grown threadbare with repeated rapping
and long intervals of waiting that a small, neatly
dressed colored girl, seemingly not over fifteen
years of age, opened the door and invited him
to walk inside.</p>

<p>“Magnolia,” called a voice from the direction
of the back stairs. “Show the gentleman into
the parlor.”</p>

<p>“Yassam,” Magnolia’s expansive smile disclosed
a row of perfect teeth. “Dis hyar way,
suh; de madam will be long d’reckly. Who did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>you say, suh?” evidently impressed with his
stylish frock coat and neatly creased trousers.
“Miss Polly done gone away.”</p>

<p>“I wish to see Mrs. Davis,” and Latimer
handed her a visiting card.</p>

<p>“Yas, suh, sutenly, suh.” Magnolia, meeting
his friendly smile, grinned from ear to ear, then
bolted with astonishing rapidity out of the room.
She was totally oblivious of the fact that her
youthful, penetrating voice, raised to a pitch to
reach Mrs. Davis standing on the top stair landing,
carried her words to Latimer’s ears.</p>

<p>“Dar’s a splendiferous lookin’ gentle’um in his
Sunday clothes waitin’ ter see yo’; no, ma’am, he
didn’t arsk fo’ Miss Polly, jes’ fo’ you’&mdash;he’s
got on great big spectacles and a top hat. What
dat&mdash;you wish de gentle’um’s cyard? Laws,
’scuse me, I done forgot”&mdash;and with a loud
snicker, Magnolia raced up the steps and pushed
the pasteboard into Mrs. Davis’s outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>Latimer had met Mrs. Davis a number of times
at Mrs. Hale’s and she had chaperoned a number
of parties given in Polly’s honor by John Hale.
She looked extremely pretty, with her soft gray
hair becomingly dressed, her cheeks, unwrinkled
in spite of multiplied cares, held a deeper touch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>of color as she entered the parlor and greeted
Latimer. He admired her gentle manner and her
air of breeding which no contact with the rough
workaday world had the power to efface.</p>

<p>“I trust I have not disturbed you by selecting
this unconventional hour to call,” he began, seating
himself somewhat gingerly on the edge of a
rickety antique chair which had been the pride of
Polly’s great grandfather. “Your maid said
that Miss Polly was out, and as my errand is
somewhat urgent, I asked to see you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis’s brilliant color receded somewhat
and her left hand played nervously with her chain
of coral from which was suspended a gold locket.</p>

<p>“You are always welcome,” she said, “no
matter what your errand.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” and Latimer, much touched, smiled
with equal cordiality. “I am in immediate need
of a first class stenographer, and I wondered if I
could persuade Miss Polly to forsake Robert Hale
and come to me. I will double her present
salary.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis drew in her breath. “That is a
handsome offer,” she exclaimed. “Of course I
cannot answer for Polly, but, as she has already
resigned her position with Robert Hale&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She has resigned, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Davis looked her surprise at the
abruptness of the question. “I&mdash;I did not approve
of her working so late at night. Mr. Hale
is kind in his way, but he is most exacting. The
idea of keeping her out until long after midnight
on Tuesday, and night before last, and then letting
her come home in the street cars! He might
at least, have sent her home in his limousine.”
Mrs. Davis came to an indignant pause and Latimer
looked his sympathy.</p>

<p>“Miss Polly will have no night work to do
for me,” he said. “And the office hours are not
long&mdash;the Stock Exchange closes early, you
know, and not much business is transacted after
that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis nodded her head wisely. “I realize
that,” she agreed. “The stock market appears
a bit more lively just now, Mr. Latimer.
Tell me,”&mdash;and she lowered her voice to a confidential
pitch&mdash;“how are the Troy Valve bonds
rated now?”</p>

<p>“They have picked up five points.” Latimer
regarded her in some surprise. “I did not know
you took an interest in the stock market, Mrs.
Davis.”</p>

<p>She colored painfully. “In former years we
were large stockholders,” she said; “now, alas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>our securities have shrunk to these of Valve
bonds. I must tell Polly what you say. It is
always well to sell on a rising market, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“If you wish to sell, yes,” dryly. Latimer,
conscious of the passing time, was having difficulty
concealing his uneasiness as he thought of
John Hale waiting a block away in his car. In
his impatience he might forget the rôle he had cast
for Latimer and, instead of awaiting the latter’s
return, walk in at any moment and, by incautious
questions, betray his own plot to discover Polly’s
whereabouts. “How soon will Miss Polly be
in?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is at Markham, Virginia, with my
cousin, Mrs. Paul Davis,” she responded easily.
“You had best write to her there or, if you prefer,
I will write and tell her of your offer.”</p>

<p>“That is kind of you.” Latimer had some
difficulty schooling his voice to the proper pitch
of enthusiasm for his rôle. “But I must have
Miss Polly’s answer to-day. Can we not call her
up on the long distance? I see your telephone is
in that corner”&mdash;and he stepped toward it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis stopped him with a gesture. “No
use, Mrs. Paul Davis has no telephone,” she
stated calmly. “I can send my letter special delivery
and she will get it to-day and wire to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
morning when the telegraph office is
open.”</p>

<p>“That would perhaps be best.” Latimer made
no effort, however, to conceal his disappointment.
“Is there any chance of Miss Polly’s returning
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” Mrs. Davis smiled in open amusement.
“She left for Markham only this morning.”</p>

<p>“In that case it looks as if I shall have to
wait until to-morrow,” Latimer’s voice was rueful.
“I wish that I had asked John Hale to tell
Miss Polly last night that I wished to engage
her as my secretary.”</p>

<p>“John did not see Polly last night.” A faint
hardness crept into Mrs. Davis’s softly modulated
tone. “She worked very late at the Hales’”&mdash;she
hesitated, looked up, and caught his sympathetic
expression. “Oh, Mr. Latimer, I cannot
help feeling that Polly sees too much of the Hales&mdash;thinks
too much of them and their interests&mdash;they
are so cold-blooded&mdash;so calculating. I
wish”&mdash;and her voice choked with feeling&mdash;“I
wish that she had been dead before she ever saw
John Hale.”</p>

<p>Latimer regarded Mrs. Davis steadily. “John
is a good fellow,” he protested, “a loyal friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>and a devoted admirer of your daughter.” He
studied her covertly. “Much more so than
Austin&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are wrong”&mdash;Mrs. Davis
stopped and cast a frightened look about the
room. “Poor Austin, I cannot realize that he
has gone from us. He was so full of life, so
anxious to succeed&mdash;his death is a tragedy.”</p>

<p>“And a mystery,” supplemented Latimer
dryly.</p>

<p>“A mystery indeed.” Mrs. Davis raised a
small perfumed handkerchief to her dry eyes.
“My heart goes out to the Hales, they have much
to endure.” Latimer stared&mdash;she was expressing
somewhat contradictory views about the Hale
family almost in one breath. She moved closer
to him. “Have the police discovered any fresh
clews?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge.” Latimer edged toward
the hall door. He dared not linger, every
extra moment might bring John Hale in search
of him. “Suppose you write to your daughter,
Mrs. Davis, and I will also send her a note within
the hour. If you have word from her will you
promise to let me know at once?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” Mrs. Davis accompanied him to
the front door. “I feel sure Polly will gladly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>accept your offer. How soon would you wish
her to commence work?”</p>

<p>“Immediately.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Davis looked taken aback. “She
really needs rest and recreation, Mr. Latimer.
Remember, she has just started on her vacation.”</p>

<p>Latimer thought a moment. “She might come
to me for a few weeks, just over this month, then
go on another vacation, or rather, continue this
one, with pay.”</p>

<p>“I will write that to Polly.” She shook his
hand warmly. “I appreciate your kindness and
I am confident that Polly will come to you if
she is physically able.”</p>

<p>“Then I am fortunate,” laughed Latimer.
Mrs. Davis’s smile was infectious.</p>

<p>“Just a moment.” Mrs. Davis detained him
as he was about to run down the steps. Her
pretty coaxing manner reminded him of Polly&mdash;mother
and daughter were much alike in appearance;
only to Latimer’s fastidious taste, Mrs.
Davis was the more attractive. There was a certain
aggressiveness about Polly, in spite of her
good looks, which always repelled him. “Please
treat what I said just now about John Hale as
strictly confidential.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, madam,” and Latimer returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>the pressure of her hand, then he continued down
the steps, her parting hail ringing in his ears:</p>

<p>“Remember, not a word!”</p>

<p>When Latimer rounded the corner into Pennsylvania
Avenue where John Hale had agreed
to wait for him, his face was grave. He said
nothing as he climbed into the car and dropped
down beside his friend, but as the car continued
up the avenue, he broke his silence.</p>

<p>“I failed,” he admitted honestly, and a groan
of disappointment broke from John Hale.
“Don’t worry, I’ll get Polly’s address to-morrow.
Mrs. Davis thinks I called to engage Polly as
my secretary.”</p>

<p>Had either Latimer or John Hale turned his
head and looked backward he could not have
failed to see a woman standing under a tree at
the corner of John Marshall Place. Their car
was lost in the traffic before Mrs. Davis, recovering
from a feeling of breathlessness produced by
the unusual exertion of running, turned slowly
homeward.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PUSH BUTTON</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Hale</span> contemplated Anna, the
waitress, with marked disapproval.</p>

<p>“You should not attempt to exert
yourself until Dr. McLane gives you permission,”
she announced, with severity.</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane told me to walk about as much
as possible, madam.” Anna’s manner was respectful
almost to the point of servility. “He
promised to be here this afternoon. Indeed, Mrs.
Hale, I’ll be careful. Don’t worry, madam.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the doctor knows what he is about”&mdash;Mrs.
Hale, however, looked extremely doubtful
as she spoke. Her own attacks of illness were
distinct trials to every member of her family,
as her chronic objection to following the doctor’s
orders or taking his medicines generally retarded
her recovery and produced a wish that “the Old
Scratch” would get her, that opinion having been
voiced by a long-suffering trained nurse, whose
training had not included a course in insults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Dr. McLane is sometimes inclined to error,”
Mrs. Hale continued after a slight pause.
“Don’t take his directions too literally, Anna.
Modify them. If he said walk about for an hour,
cut it to one half. And never take a full dose of
anything prescribed, reduce it by one half.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam; thank you,” and Anna executed
a bob of a courtesy in spite of her injured ankle.
“Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Now, mind what I say,
don’t overexert yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” and Anna started for the door
only to be called back by Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p>“As you go downstairs please tell Maud that
Mr. Latimer will lunch with us&mdash;that is, I think
he will, but he hasn’t answered my telephone
message.” Mrs. Hale thought a minute.
“Maud can put a place for him.”</p>

<p>“Very well, madam.”</p>

<p>“Wait, there’s one thing more.” Mrs. Hale
laid aside her knitting bag, preparatory to rising.
“See that the table is properly set, Anna, please.
Maud is&mdash;eh&mdash;not particular, and I am.”</p>

<p>“I will set the table myself, madam.”</p>

<p>“No, no, that is too much exertion for you,
Anna.”</p>

<p>“But, madam, I am strong again, see”&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>Anna stepped across the room. Her limp was
slight. Mrs. Hale heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“You have had a remarkable recovery,” she
exclaimed. “My remedies can be relied on to
effect a quick cure. By the way,”&mdash;the thought
of luncheon uppermost for the moment&mdash;“if
there is time enough, please make an apple salad.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, madam. Is there anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, I can think of nothing.” Mrs. Hale
wrinkled her brow, but no new ideas came to her
active brain. “Where is Miss Judith?”</p>

<p>“In her boudoir, madam.” Anna, who had
taken several steps toward the door, paused.
“Maud told me just now that Miss Judith and
Detective Ferguson have been holding a long”&mdash;Anna
hesitated&mdash;“conference.”</p>

<p>“Conference!” Mrs. Hale’s tone expressed
astonishment. “Oh!” and she stared at the
waiting servant. “That is all, Anna,” and the
waitress made her escape.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale crossed the drawing-room and stood
before the large gilt-framed wall mirror which
gave her a full length view of her figure. It took
several minutes to rearrange a bow of ribbon and
several pieces of jewelry, after which Mrs. Hale
proceeded leisurely to the third floor. She did
not often climb to that height, and, on reaching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>the head of the stairs, she paused to take breath,
then, passing down the broad hall, she turned the
knob of a closed door and entered a semidarkened
room.</p>

<p>It took her several seconds to pull up the
Holland shades of the dormer windows and flood
the bedroom with sunlight. When she turned
around she saw a man sitting on the edge of the
bed watching her. A slight scream broke from
her and she swayed dizzily. With a bound the
man gained her side.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, Mrs. Hale. It is only
I, Detective Ferguson,” he explained. “I
thought you saw me when you first entered the
room.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale shook her head as she sank into the
chair he placed for her.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” she exclaimed, “I declare you gave
me quite a turn. I had no idea I should find any
one in Austin’s bedroom.” Resentment against
its cause conquered her fright in some measure
and she whirled on him. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“I might ask the question of you,” he retorted
coolly seating himself opposite her.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” Mrs. Hale continued to
stare at him. Then, as he evinced no desire to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>address her, her manner changed. “I heard you
were in the house,” she began, ignoring his question
as he had hers; “and I intended to ask you
not to leave until I had seen you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Hale’s manner was graciousness
itself. “And I am glad to have this opportunity
for a private interview.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Ferguson resorted to brevity while
striving to divine a reason for her sudden change
of manner.</p>

<p>“I have wanted so much to question you,” she
announced. “Have you made any progress in
solving the mystery of Austin’s death?”</p>

<p>“It depends on what you term ‘progress,’” he
responded dryly.</p>

<p>“Have you discovered any clew to his&mdash;his
murderer?” she hesitated over the last word.
“Now, don’t put me off with stupid evasions,”
she added. “How do you know, if we talk over
details <i>together</i>,” with marked emphasis, “that I
may not be able to detect some point of vital importance
which <i>you</i> may have overlooked?”</p>

<p>Ferguson gazed at her reflectively. There was
something in what she said. Was she really the
fool he had taken her for all along? If she was,
and she held some knowledge which would aid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>him in elucidating the Hale mystery, it would be
to his advantage to win her confidence&mdash;if
necessary, with a show of confidence on his part.</p>

<p>“That is not a bad idea,” he acknowledged.
“I’ve handled many puzzling cases, but this one,”&mdash;he
paused&mdash;“this one has taken the lead”;
then, as she started to interrupt him, he added,
“Here are the facts so far known,”&mdash;he smiled&mdash;“publicly.
Young Austin Hale&mdash;by the way,
what was his exact relationship to you?”</p>

<p>“A nephew by adoption, at which time Austin
assumed the name of Hale,” was her concise
reply, so unlike her usual flowery style of conversation
that it drew a smile from the detective.
“His proper name was Payne&mdash;Austin Payne.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Ferguson was watching her as a cat
watches a mouse. He had maneuvered his chair
so that his back was to the light while she faced
the sun’s merciless rays. “Austin returns to this
house unexpectedly on Tuesday night, is found
by your son-in-law, Major Richards, stabbed to
death, and not a soul in your house knows anything
about the tragedy.” Ferguson’s gesture
was expressive. “No weapon to be found but a
pair of shears, no motive for the crime but the
theft of a more or less valuable antique watch&mdash;a
watch whose very ownership would lead to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>arrest on suspicion. There was no trace of a
burglar’s having broken into the house. Therefore
the crime must have been committed by an
inmate of your house, Mrs. Hale.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she protested vehemently, and he
detected the whitening of her cheeks under the
delicately applied rouge.</p>

<p>“And every member of your household has
an excellent alibi,” he went on, not heeding her
interruption. “There must be a flaw somewhere;
there has to be one.” And he lent emphasis
to his words by striking his clenched fist in
the palm of his left hand. “Now, where is the
flaw?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale looked away from him, then back
again. “I wish I knew,” she wailed, and two
large tears rolled down her cheeks. “I’ve racked
my brain trying to find a solution to the mystery,
and at last I came up here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“To see if Austin dropped any paper&mdash;any
note paper, so big”&mdash;and she demonstrated an
approximate size while Ferguson listened eagerly.
“Austin must have had some reason for returning
so unexpectedly.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” agreed Ferguson. “And
you think there may be a clew tucked away in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>bedroom. Well, we think alike in that. It is
the same line of reasoning which brought me up
here.” Mrs. Hale winked away her tears and
brightened visibly; she was easily influenced by
flattery and Ferguson’s tone of comradeship
tinged with admiration completely won her.
“This room has been thoroughly searched.”</p>

<p>“But something may have been overlooked,”
she interrupted eagerly.</p>

<p>“Exactly&mdash;suppose we look,” and, rising,
Ferguson aided her in her rapid investigation of
the bureau drawers. They were rewarded by
finding only a few articles of wearing apparel.
Her ardor somewhat dampened, Mrs. Hale accompanied
the detective to the closet and stepped
inside its commodious depths.</p>

<p>“This is evidently the overcoat and hat Austin
was wearing on Tuesday night,” Ferguson
pointed out, holding them up for her inspection.
“And here is the coat of his suit,” removing it
from the hook as he spoke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale shrank back, then shaking off her
slight feeling of repugnance she deliberately
searched every pocket&mdash;to find a silk handkerchief
and a gold card case in which were Austin’s
visiting cards.</p>

<p>“Austin must have come direct to his bedroom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>on reaching here Tuesday night,” Ferguson remarked
as he replaced the coat. “Why he went
downstairs in his vest and shirt sleeves, I cannot
imagine.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was in the midst of dressing and
was called downstairs,” suggested Mrs. Hale and
her voice indicated pleased surprise at her own
astuteness.</p>

<p>“Who called him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea”&mdash;she did not
lower her eyes before Ferguson’s penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>“If it had been a woman,” mused Ferguson,
“he surely would have stopped to put on his
coat.”</p>

<p>“Not if he was urgently needed downstairs.”</p>

<p>“But who could have ‘urgently needed him’?”
questioned Ferguson swiftly. “Your daughter&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Was unaware of his presence in the house,”
haughtily. “She stood in no need of Austin’s
assistance&mdash;put that idea out of your head instantly.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstood me,” he protested. “I
was only going to say that your daughter was the
only woman on the next floor.”</p>

<p>“So we suppose.”</p>

<p>Ferguson caught her up. “Do you suspect another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
woman was here?” he demanded. “If so
who was it&mdash;one of your servants?”</p>

<p>“No, they were asleep in their rooms.” Mrs.
Hale resumed her seat. She was commencing to
feel fatigued. “You have assured yourself of
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” acknowledged Ferguson. “We can
eliminate them. I am, however, considering all
the women who <i>might</i> have been here. You&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I?” Although Mrs. Hale laughed heartily in
amusement, there was a false note in her somewhat
high-pitched voice. “You surely do not
suspect <i>me</i>? Why, my dear man, I was at the
French Embassy reception; there are plenty of
friends to testify to that besides my brother-in-law,
John Hale, who took me to the reception and
brought me home. You were here when we both
arrived.”</p>

<p>Ferguson laughed with her. “I was just running
over the people who belong in this house,”
he explained. “Your husband was ill&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And in bed,” she interpolated.</p>

<p>“The servants in their quarters; Mrs. Richards
in her room&mdash;at least”&mdash;with a sharp look
at her. “She was in her room, was she not?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. She has a suite of rooms on the
floor below.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“I was just in there.” Ferguson paused, then
went back to what he had been saying. “Major
Richards was at the Metropolitan Club on Tuesday
night.”</p>

<p>“So he told us.” Mrs. Hale raised her hands
and dropped them with a hopeless gesture.
“Every person is accounted for&mdash;we are just
where we started.”</p>

<p>“Not quite.” Ferguson hesitated and glanced
about the room. Mrs. Hale, upon entering, had
closed the door behind her, and there seemed no
likelihood of their conversation’s being overheard.
“I found on further inquiry at the Metropolitan
Club that Major Richards was last seen there
about midnight. The doorman on duty Tuesday
night declares he did not see him leave the club,
and does not know the hour of his departure for
home.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” questioned Mrs. Hale,
as he stopped.</p>

<p>“This: according to Major Richards, he
reached this house about twenty minutes past one
o’clock in the morning and he was last seen in
the club a little before midnight. It leaves an
hour of his time unaccounted for, and it was during
that hour that Austin Hale was murdered.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale sat speechless for a minute. “Preposterous!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
she exclaimed hotly, recovering from
her surprise “Why should Major Richards kill
a man he does not know?”</p>

<p>Ferguson glanced uneasily at her and came to a
quick decision.</p>

<p>“Suppose Major Richards came home and
found Austin talking to his wife and became
jealous&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale bounced out of her chair. “How
dare you insinuate that Judith was having an affair
with Austin?” she demanded. “You are
most insulting&mdash;I shall inform Major Richards&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear madam, pray, calm yourself,”
Ferguson begged, appalled by the storm he had
provoked. “I thought we agreed to talk over all
aspects of the Hale murder&mdash;it was your own
suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Certainly it was, but I did not expect&mdash;”
Mrs. Hale sniffed. “If you ask Major Richards
to account for all his time Tuesday night he will
do so, I am convinced. A man of his temperament
and record&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where is his record?” broke in Ferguson.
“What is his record? I cannot learn anything
about him.”</p>

<p>“His record is on file in the War Department.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“His army record, yes.” Ferguson pulled out
his watch and jumped to his feet “Pardon me,
Mrs. Hale, but I have a consultation at my office
and must leave at once.”</p>

<p>“Tell me before you go,”&mdash;Mrs. Hale detained
him with a gesture&mdash;“did you find anywhere
among Austin’s belongings either here or
in New York a railroad ticket?”</p>

<p>“A ticket? No.” Ferguson eyed her sharply.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if he had just stopped over
a train on his way south,” she explained glibly.
“It was just an idea&mdash;don’t let me detain you
longer.”</p>

<p>Ferguson halted in indecision; however, his engagement
brooked no further delay if he was to
be on time for it. He could question Mrs. Hale
later in the day.</p>

<p>“I will return,” he said. “But if you desire
me at any time, please telephone, Mrs. Hale.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p>Left to her own resources, Mrs. Hale diligently
searched the room. She had about decided to
stop, disgusted with her lack of results when on
feeling about in the depths of the top drawer of
Austin’s bureau she touched a small book, and
pulled it out. On its leather cover she saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>stamped in gold the insignia of a Senior secret
society at Yale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale turned over several of the leaves and
glanced down the pages, hesitated a moment then,
placing the book in her convenient knitting bag,
she proceeded to the dining room to make certain
that Maud had properly set the luncheon table.
She was particular about small household details.
As she passed the door of Judith’s boudoir she
failed to see Richards standing somewhat in its
shadow regarding her. Richards was still gazing
after her retreating figure when Judith, who was
in their bedroom dressing for luncheon, called to
him.</p>

<p>“Please ring for Maud,” she asked as he appeared,
and obediently he returned to the boudoir
and reached for the push button. The act was
mechanical, and it was not until he had made three
attempts to ring the bell that he realized that the
small object he was fingering was not the push
button.</p>

<p>Richards stepped back and surveyed the boudoir
walls. The bell he sought was on the other
side of the door leading into their bedroom. After
pressing the button he walked back and examined
the little object on the opposite wall. To all
intents and purposes it resembled an electric push
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>button, hanging just below an enlarged photograph
of Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p>Richards’ strong sensitive fingers felt behind
the framed photograph until they encountered a
tiny wire. It wound in and out along the picture
wire until it encountered the wires of the branch
telephone. He stood in deep thought for some
minutes, then walked into the bedroom.</p>

<p>“Can I be of service, dear?” he asked his
wife. “Maud hasn’t answered the bell.”</p>

<p>Judith, wrestling with a refractory hook, shook
her head. “Thanks, but Maud’s clever fingers
are needed to disentangle this mess,” she said.
“Do you mind running downstairs and telling
her to come to me? The bell must be out of
order.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have her here in a jiffy,” Richards answered,
but, once in the hall, his footsteps lagged.</p>

<p>No one was in sight, and getting down on his
knees he felt along the telephone wire which ran
on top of the wall board. The same fine wire was
fastened in place alongside it. Step by step
Richards traced the two wires running side by side
until they crossed the door-jamb of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Hale’s bedroom. They were old-fashioned
in their ideas and occupied the same room.</p>

<p>Richards tapped, first gently, then more loudly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>on the partly opened door and getting no response,
he walked inside. It was a large room filled with
handsome mahogany furniture, the carved four-post
bedstead taking up the greater space. But
Richards had eyes for but one object standing on
a table in an obscure corner of the room, with a
soft typewriter cover partly concealing the receivers
and earpieces from view. Walking over
to it, Richards lifted the cover and examined the
instrument. When he laid the cover down his
expression indicated incredulity and a dawning
horror.</p>

<p>With what object had Robert Hale or his wife,
or both, placed a dictograph in Judith’s boudoir?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nna</span>, the waitress, answered Robert
Hale’s persistent ring of the front bell
with all the speed her strained ankle
would permit. At sight of her, Hale restrained
an outburst of temper and with a mumbled,
“Thanks,” stamped past her into the central hall
of his home.</p>

<p>“Is my brother in the house, Anna?” he inquired,
tossing down his overcoat and hat on the
first chair he came to.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I believe so.” Anna closed the front
door as an icy current of air blew her becoming
cap at right angles. “His hat and cane are here
on the coat stand, and I heard him ask Mr. Latimer
to go to his room with him as they left the
dining room after luncheon.”</p>

<p>Hale paused on his way to the library. “Who
lunched here?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hale, Miss Judith, Major Richards, Mr.
Latimer, and Mr. John, sir,” Anna explained in
detail. “Mrs. Hale complained of a headache
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>and the Major volunteered to take her for a run
in Miss Judith’s electric.”</p>

<p>“Did Miss Judith accompany them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Hale looked at the pretty waitress. It was the
first time that he had seen her since her injury to
her ankle. Contrary to expectations, he had not
returned for luncheon but had remained at the
club.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, Anna?” he asked
kindly. “Not overdoing it by being about too
soon, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Anna flushed with pleasure. Hale
seldom addressed her, much less took an interest
in her welfare, and she had some ado to conceal
her surprise. “I’m feeling fine, sir. Is there
anything I can do for you, sir, before I go upstairs?”</p>

<p>“You are going upstairs?” Hale halted.
“Then please stop at Mr. John’s room and
tell him that I would like to see him alone in the
den.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” and Anna sought the back
stairs and limped her way to the third floor.</p>

<p>John Hale’s bedroom was almost directly opposite
that occupied by his stepson Austin. As
Anna came down the hall she was greeted by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>tobacco smoke which drifted through the open
transom over John Hale’s door. In response to
her knock he came into the hall.</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. John, your brother wishes
to see you alone in the den,” she said.</p>

<p>“Now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose so. Mr. Hale just said
that he would like to see you,” and having delivered
her message, Anna executed her bob of a
courtesy and went her way.</p>

<p>John Hale walked back into his bedroom with
a scowling face, and over to the divan where
Frank Latimer lounged, smoking his inevitable
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Robert’s sent for me,” he stated. “What do
you suppose he is up to?”</p>

<p>Latimer dropped his cigarette in the smoking
stand and stood up.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Davis told me, you recollect, that Polly
had resigned her position as his secretary,” he
reminded him. “Probably your brother has just
received a note from her.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” John Hale’s scowl vanished.
“The note may give Polly’s address. Come on,
Frank,” and he made for the door, followed in a
more leisurely fashion by his companion.</p>

<p>“Didn’t your brother send word that he wished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>to see you alone?” he asked. “I thought I heard
Anna tell you so.”</p>

<p>“She did, that’s true”&mdash;John Hale paused at
the head of the staircase. “Wait for me, will
you? I won’t be long. And then, if there is no
address on Polly’s note, we’ll motor to Markham
and see for ourselves if Polly is there or not.”</p>

<p>“But, look here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No ‘buts,’” John Hale slapped him on the
back. The prospect of action had brought back
his spirits. “You’ve got to see me through this,
Frank, for the sake of ‘auld lang syne.’ You’ve
kept me out of trouble before, remember that”&mdash;and
he gripped Latimer’s hand and wrung it.</p>

<p>“It looks as if I had contracted for a big job,”
groaned Latimer, expanding his fingers which
tingled from John Hale’s pressure. “I’ll gladly
turn you over to Polly with my blessings. I’ll
wait for you in the library, but don’t be long.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and the two friends parted on the
second floor.</p>

<p>John Hale did not go at once to his brother’s
den. Instead, he watched Latimer disappear
down the circular staircase, then very slowly
crossed the hall and looked inside Judith’s boudoir.
It was empty. With indecision written
plainly on his face, he turned about and sought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>the den. Robert Hale looked up from his desk,
where he was writing with feverish speed, as his
brother entered.</p>

<p>“Close the door, John,” he directed, and waited
in silence until his brother had crossed the room
and stood by the fireplace, in which a gas log
burned. “Sit down.”</p>

<p>John Hale regarded his brother with no
friendly eyes. He had always resented what he
termed “Robert’s elder brother act,” and his dictatorial
manner generally grated, besides which
their natures were too diametrically opposed ever
to agree on any subject. John’s height and commanding
figure had always been a source of envy
to his delicate brother, while the latter’s scientific
achievements and financial prosperity had served
to widen the breach between them.</p>

<p>“I can stay only a minute,” John announced,
lounging against the mantel. “What do you
wish to see me about?”</p>

<p>Hale’s thin lips tightened into a straight line.
“Sit down first,”&mdash;his manner was a bit more
courteous&mdash;“and I will explain. No, take that
chair where you can face me,” and John, against
his wishes, dropped into a seat facing not only his
brother but the full glare of light from the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” he asked, as his brother
volunteered no remark.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the present whereabouts of
my secretary, Polly Davis?” asked Hale.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because she has sent me her resignation, and
I desire to find out where she has gone and why
she has skipped.”</p>

<p>“Skipped?” There was instant anger in
John’s loud tone. “What d’ye mean,
‘skipped’?”</p>

<p>“Run away, if you like it better.” It was impossible
to mistake Hale’s sneering manner.
With a curse, John started from his chair.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“Quiet, John,” cautioned Hale suavely.
“Hear what I have to say before you lose your
temper.”</p>

<p>John dropped back in his chair. “Go on,” he
shouted, “but don’t try me too far; keep a civil
tongue when you speak of Polly&mdash;she is
pure and sweet and I’ll not have her character
defiled.”</p>

<p>“And she met Austin here on Tuesday night,”
Hale commented dryly. “You know Austin’s
reputation&mdash;sit down!” as John again started to
his feet. “Either hear me to the end or leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>now,” and Hale threw himself back in his seat.
“I will not be interrupted every second.”</p>

<p>With difficulty the younger brother mastered
his rage. At all cost he felt that he must get
information about Polly, and he could do so only
by maintaining self-control. He knew his
brother too well to doubt that if Hale awoke
to the fact that John desired such information he
would withhold it from sheer deviltry.</p>

<p>“I am listening,” he said sullenly. “Only remember,
my time is valuable.”</p>

<p>Hale smiled with his lips only. “Let us face
the situation,” he remarked. “Polly met Austin
here on Tuesday night&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How do you know she did?” John demanded
hotly.</p>

<p>“I saw her,” calmly.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;” John stared at him. “You were
ill in bed.”</p>

<p>“I was ill&mdash;but not in bed,” corrected Hale.
“Anna had forgotten to put a glass of ice water
on my bed table and, becoming thirsty, I got up,
walked down the hall and helped myself from
the pitcher and glasses which always stand there
at night.” He paused. “I started to return
when I thought I heard a woman crying and I
took several steps down the circular staircase&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” prompted John, as his brother
stopped to take breath. “Continue.”</p>

<p>“You are interested?” A mocking gleam
shone for an instant in Hale’s deep-set eyes. “I
glanced over the bannister into the central hall and
saw Polly Davis come out of the library.”</p>

<p>The silence in the den grew oppressive. Suddenly
John Hale raised both hands and tugged at
his collar as if for air. Then, just as suddenly,
his hands fell to his sides.</p>

<p>“What followed?” he asked, and Hale wondered
at the moderation of his tone. He had expected
a tongue-lashing at the least, if not a
physical encounter&mdash;his taut muscles relaxed and
he assumed an easier position.</p>

<p>“Polly stood clinging to the portières for an
instant, then before I could call to her, she ran to
the front door and dashed outside,” Hale continued.</p>

<p>“Did you go downstairs?” questioned John.</p>

<p>“No, I did not feel equal to the exertion,” Hale
explained. “I returned to bed.”</p>

<p>“What? Without going to see what Polly was
doing here and why she should be crying?” asked
John incredulously.</p>

<p>Hale smiled cynically. “I have been brought
up on woman’s tears,” he remarked. “Agatha
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>has let loose the floodgates so often that I am
schooled to indifference. I supposed Polly had
been with Judith in the library, and it was not
until I was told of Austin’s death that I ascribed
another reason for her presence here after midnight.”</p>

<p>John looked at him with bloodshot eyes.
“Don’t try me too far,” he warned. “It
wouldn’t take much to kill you,” and he extended
his powerful hands, fingers distended as if to grip
their prey.</p>

<p>His brother watched him unmoved.</p>

<p>“It is easy to kill a man&mdash;witness Austin’s
murder,” he commented. “But it is unpleasant
to swing for the crime. I am glad Polly has
bolted.”</p>

<p>“You jump to conclusions,” retorted John.
“Because <i>you</i> saw Polly coming out of the library
it does not prove that she killed Austin, nor does
it prove that she knew he was here, nor that she
talked with him.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” agreed Hale; “but in addition
to seeing her leave the library I know that she
had borrowed Agatha’s latchkey. I know she
expected to see Austin&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Prove it,” John shouted. “I demand proof.”</p>

<p>Hale unlocked his desk drawer, took out a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>crumpled sheet of typewriting, and, still retaining
a firm hold on the sheet, extended it so that his
brother could read the words. “This is a page
copied from my manuscript,” he explained.
“Polly spoiled the sheet by reversing the carbon,”&mdash;he
turned it over and showed the impression on
the other side&mdash;“but before she did so she indicated
where her thoughts were straying by this”&mdash;and
his finger pointed to the typed lines, repeated
several times at the bottom of the sheet:</p>

<p>“Saw Austin 10-t-b-53-76c.”</p>

<p>“What gibberish is that?” asked John scornfully.</p>

<p>“Not gibberish,” calmly, “but the combination
of my safe.”</p>

<p>The striking of the clock as the hands registered
three sounded like a knell in John Hale’s ears.
His brother was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“These links in the chain of evidence considered
separately are weak,” he admitted candidly,
“but taken together, they are strong.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” protested John. “It is
all circumstantial evidence&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To which Polly has lent substance by her disappearance,”
retorted Hale: “Had she stayed
here and continued as my secretary, attention
would not have been attracted to her.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>
<p>John did not reply at once and Hale, watching
him, noted his changed expression with bated
interest.</p>

<p>“To sum up,”&mdash;Hale’s voice cut the silence
and scraped afresh John’s raw nerves&mdash;“Polly
was engaged to Austin&mdash;can you deny it?”
Receiving no reply, he went on, “Polly knew he
would be here Tuesday night, witness her presence
in the house at midnight; she supplied him
with the combination of my safe; she was seen
leaving the library at the very time he must have
been murdered, and his body was found lying near
the <i>open</i> safe&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on, she may have been here and all
that,” John broke in with rough vehemence, “but
some one else may have killed Austin even in her
presence&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then why has she not told the police?”
John remained silent, and his brother continued
speaking. “I hoped Polly would brave it out
here, and to reduce her anxieties&mdash;for I know
how pushed she is for money&mdash;I increased her
salary and held my tongue.”</p>

<p>John stared at him long and intently before
again addressing him.</p>

<p>“Why have you kept silent and not informed
the police of your suspicions?” he asked, curiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
“Charity is not usually one of your
virtues.”</p>

<p>“Austin deserved what he got,” Hale answered
slowly. “And&mdash;I was always fond of a sporting
chance. Therefore, John, find Polly and I
will aid you to finance a trip to a country where
extradition is not enforced.”</p>

<p>John’s face flamed scarlet. Slowly his color
ebbed and his hands unclenched, and when he
spoke his voice was low and measured.</p>

<p>“Where am I to find Polly?”</p>

<p>Hale took a letter from his desk. “Polly
writes that she is called out of town and, not
knowing the date of her return, fears that she
will be unable to continue as my secretary, and
with every good wish, begs to remain faithfully
mine.” Hale shrugged his shoulders by way of
comment, and added: “The letter is dated this
morning, has no street address on it, and was
sent to my club. See for yourself,” and he tossed
the letter to him.</p>

<p>John read the familiar writing several times,
then folding the sheet, tucked it in his pocket and
rose.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else you wish to see me
about?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.” Hale turned carelessly back to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>desk. “Take a fool’s advice and do not procrastinate
in your search for Polly.”</p>

<p>John walked in silence to the door. Once there,
he looked back and addressed his brother.</p>

<p>“Some day I’ll wring your damn neck!” he
exclaimed, and his brother’s mocking laughter was
still ringing in his ears as he went down the circular
staircase.</p>

<p>The sound of voices at the front door aroused
him from his thoughts, and, looking in that direction,
he saw Maud, the parlor maid, conversing
with a District messenger boy. She was in the
act of signing a receipt when an oblong package
on which she was trying to write, slipped from
her awkward fingers and struck with a resounding
thud on the marble floor of the vestibule.
There was a tinkle of broken glass as the tissue
paper covering burst. The messenger, scenting
trouble, snatched the receipt out of her hand and
bolted down the steps, while Maud, with a loud
exclamation, stooped and picked up the package.</p>

<p>“Look at that, now!” she gasped in tragic
tones, as John Hale stopped beside her.
“What’ll I do? I’ve broken the crystal of Major
Richards’ watch.” And tearing off the remains
of the tissue paper, she held the piece of jewelry
before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>John Hale scarcely heard her words, his attention
was entirely centered on the open-faced
watch. Small bits of crystal still clung to its
face, but the dial had not been injured and the
hands were intact.</p>

<p>“Where did the watch come from?” he asked,
and at the eagerness in his voice Maud looked up.</p>

<p>“It’s Major Richards’!” she explained.
“Jennings, the watchmaker on Fourteenth Street,
sent word by the boy that he couldn’t get it over
last night as promised, so he sent it this afternoon.
What will the Major say to me?” and
Maud’s distress found vent in a subdued sniff
presaging a burst of tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Maud; I’ll explain to Major
Richards that the accident was unavoidable. Let
me have the watch,” and as Maud expressed voluble
thanks, he sped into the library, the watch
dangling from its chain.</p>

<p>“Frank,” he cried. “Hurry, man, I’ve
found”&mdash;he checked himself at sight of Judith
sitting on the lounge talking to Latimer.</p>

<p>Judith turned her head at his abrupt entrance
and looked at him, then her eyes wandered from
his excited face to the watch which he held at
arm’s length as he advanced toward them.</p>

<p>“See!” he exclaimed, and rested the watch on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>the tufted side of the lounge, where both Judith
and Latimer had a close view of its antique
beauty. Judith bent closer and when she straightened
up her face was flushed.</p>

<p>“It is Austin’s watch!” she declared. “I can
swear to it.”</p>

<p>“You need not swear&mdash;it is Austin’s watch,”
John Hale’s tone was cold and cutting. “But
you can explain how the watch came in the possession
of your husband, Major Richards.”</p>

<p>Judith’s bright color faded. “It is in your
possession, and not in the possession of my husband,”
she retorted. “Had you not better do
the explaining?”</p>

<p>“Willingly&mdash;the watch has been in my hands
just about four minutes.” John lifted the paper
tag attached to the chain. “Listen, Judith&mdash;‘Major
J. C. Richards&mdash;repair broken link in
chain and return immediately.’ Your husband
left the watch and chain with Jennings and he
has returned it.” John Hale moderated his rapid
speech and spoke with impressiveness. “Austin
was murdered and his watch stolen&mdash;that watch
has turned up ticketed with your husband’s name.
Kindly explain it.”</p>

<p>Judith was conscious of the intent watchfulness
of her uncle and Frank Latimer as they waited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>for her reply, and with all her will power she
strove to steady her voice.</p>

<p>“My husband is out just now,” she stated
clearly. “When he returns he will explain everything
to our satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Will he?” John Hale’s high temper had
slipped control. “I see it all now. Your father
knows your husband killed Austin, and to save
family scandal has plotted evidence against Polly
Davis, even buying her silence and providing
funds to have her disappear.”</p>

<p>“Have you taken leave of your senses?” demanded
Judith, breaking into his torrent of
words.</p>

<p>“No, on the contrary, every faculty is on the
alert,” retorted John Hale. “By God, to think
of Robert’s trying to shield Richards by making
an innocent girl appear guilty. It’s an outrage
and I’ll expose every rotten one of you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Steady, John!” Latimer stepped in front
of him. “Go easy! You shan’t insult Judith
in my presence.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you interfere. Judith shall learn the
truth about her rascally husband”&mdash;he waved
the watch in front of the white-faced girl.
“Richards took this watch from Austin as he
took your Valve bonds from your father’s safe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>I’ve got the goods on him, and he’ll swing for
Austin’s murder.”</p>

<p>“He will not!” Judith’s voice rose, clear and
strong, and silenced even her overwrought uncle.
Her eyes glowed with passionate anger as she
faced him. “You dare to threaten me, Uncle
John?”</p>

<p>“I dare to protect Polly Davis from underhand,
blackguardly treatment,” he replied. “It
is a frame-up.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” Judith’s smile was dangerous.
“Go back to Polly and take her that watch. Tell
her there is a link missing in the chain you are
trying to forge and I have it, although she may
have the Mizpah locket. Go, both of you!”</p>

<p>John Hale started as if stung. Then, without
a word he pocketed the watch and, seizing Latimer’s
arm, dragged him out of the room.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DANCING SILHOUETTES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> hearing the slam of the front door
behind her uncle and Frank Latimer,
Judith went to the windowed alcove of
the library overlooking the street on which their
house faced and, concealed from the view of
passers-by, she watched John Hale and his companion
enter the former’s touring car and drive
off. Not until the car had turned the corner did
she relax her vigilant attitude, then, turning, she
paced up and down the floor. She could not keep
still. Her nerves were aquiver, her brain on fire.</p>

<p>How had Austin’s antique watch come into her
husband’s possession? Again and again her lips
framed the same question&mdash;with but the one answer.
Richards must have taken it from Austin’s
dead body. But why&mdash;why? Austin was
wearing the watch when murdered; that she could
swear to. Had she not taken the Mizpah locket
from its chain in that awful moment when she
had first discovered his body and left the watch
with its dangling broken chain in his pocket?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>What was it her husband had told her? She
pressed her fingers against her throbbing temples
in an effort to remember. He had returned just
as she reached the hall, had carried her unconscious
to their boudoir, revived her, gone downstairs
for a bottle of bromides and discovered
Austin lying murdered in the library. She whitened
to the lips. Had he seized the opportunity
to rifle her father’s safe, the door of which
was open, before sending for the coroner and
police?</p>

<p>He had sold Valve bonds belonging to her which
had disappeared that night from the safe, and
now&mdash;Judith raised her hands in silent, passionate
protest&mdash;if Joe, in dire need of money, had
yielded to sudden overwhelming temptation and
taken her bonds, why&mdash;why had he stolen Austin’s
watch? It could bring him no money return,
for the first attempt to sell it would focus
suspicion upon him.</p>

<p>If he had been so mad as to steal the watch as
well as the bonds, why had he been so foolhardy
as to send it to a watchmaker to have the chain
repaired, trusting to any messenger to return it
to him unknown to others?</p>

<p>Judith stopped short in her restless walk as a
sudden idea occurred to her. Was her husband
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>a kleptomaniac? Had he yielded to an insane
impulse to steal? Judith racked her brain to remember
what she had heard of kleptomania&mdash;that
it was a recognized mental derangement, an
irresponsible and irresistible propensity to steal,
and that the kleptomaniac cared nothing for the
objects stolen as soon as the craze to steal was
gratified. But Joe had cared enough to sell her
Valve bonds. That might have been a sane act,
Judith acknowledged to herself bitterly, but to
take a useless watch which would surely involve
him in another and greater crime was the act of
insanity.</p>

<p><i>Would involve</i> him&mdash;it <i>had already involved</i>
him. Judith’s breath came faster and perspiration
appeared in beads on her forehead. She
knew John Hale’s stubborn will, his passionate affection
for Polly Davis&mdash;he would move heaven
and earth to convict her husband. What more
likely than that he was already at Police Headquarters
swearing out a warrant for his arrest?</p>

<p>Judith’s loyalty to her husband was instantly
in arms. He might be a kleptomaniac,&mdash;if so,
he was to be pitied and protected,&mdash;but he was
not a murderer&mdash;Judith’s faith remained unshaken.
With all her woman’s wit she would
prove him worthy of her trust and devotion, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>clear him of any suspicion of complicity in Austin’s
murder.</p>

<p>But how to go about it? The locket had disappeared
while she and her husband were sitting
in the boudoir through which the thief had to
pass to enter the bedroom. There was but one
person to her knowledge to whom the locket was
of vital importance&mdash;Polly Davis. And she,
Judith, had informed Polly that it was in her
possession only a short time before its disappearance.
But the only living persons who had had
an opportunity to steal her jewelry were&mdash;herself
or her husband.</p>

<p>Judith shuddered&mdash;had Joe’s thieving propensities
caused him to take her jewelry? Her
back had been toward him when he went to get
her glass of water, but even if there had been
time for him to slip into their bedroom and get
the jewelry, where had he hidden it without her
seeing him? Judith stared dully at the opposite
wall, despair tugging at her heartstrings.</p>

<p>“Hello, Judith,” called a cheery voice from the
doorway, and Judith, whirling around with a
violent start, saw Dr. McLane, black bag in hand,
looking at her. “I have just been upstairs treating
Anna’s ankle and I stopped in here on my way
out to see if any one was at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“Come in, doctor,” she exclaimed. “You
have arrived in answer to my thoughts.”</p>

<p>As he took her extended hand in greeting he
glanced quickly at her&mdash;her palm was dry and
hot to the touch. Instantly his fingers sought her
pulse.</p>

<p>“Come, Judith, this won’t do,” he remonstrated
gravely. “Your pulse is pounding like a
millrace. I have cautioned you before&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please, doctor, don’t scold,” she pleaded.
“It is only caused by momentary excitement. I’ll
calm down after a talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” doubtfully. “Well, fire away.”</p>

<p>Judith wheeled a chair around. “Do sit
down,” she coaxed, “I can’t think of a thing to
say while you stand with that air of bolting
away.”</p>

<p>McLane laughed as he followed her wishes,
placing the black bag within reach. “I am all
attention,” he declared. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Can kleptomania be cured?”</p>

<p>McLane stared at her; the question was unexpected.</p>

<p>“Not permanently,” he replied, and Judith,
who was toying with a fan which was attached
to a silk cord about her neck, raised it to her lips
to hide their trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“What are its symptoms?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Symptoms?” The surgeon was distinctly
puzzled by her questions. “It is a mental derangement
usually found among the wealthy
class, for the craze lies in the <i>act</i> of stealing, and
the article stolen is of indifference to the genuine
kleptomaniac and is often of no value whatever.
A thief steals for gain for himself or another.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Judith paused, and a moment later
Dr. McLane, who had been openly studying her&mdash;though
she was unconscious of it&mdash;roused
her from her bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>“Where are your mother and Major Richards?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“They have gone to Walter Reed Hospital to
see Major LeFevre,” she explained. “I did not
feel equal to the long trip and had them leave me
here after a short turn on the speedway.”</p>

<p>“It would have been better had you stayed out
in the fresh air,” commented McLane frankly.
“You are brooding too much, Judith. I fear”&mdash;with
a keen glance at her&mdash;“Austin’s death
has upset you more than you realize.”</p>

<p>“We are all upset,” she admitted. “And the
suspense&mdash;not knowing who is guilty of the
crime is terrible.” She paused a moment.
“Could it have been suicide?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>McLane shook his head. “Impossible, judging
from the nature of the wound,” he insisted.
“The autopsy proved that.”</p>

<p>Judith straightened up. “You were present at
the autopsy, were you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Doctor,”&mdash;Judith’s hesitation was perceptible
as she toyed with her fan&mdash;“do you believe that
Austin was stabbed with a pair of shears?”</p>

<p>“That is a difficult question to answer offhand,
Judith,” he replied gravely. “Austin’s death was
caused by a punctured wound. These wounds,
Judith, are generally smaller in circumference
than the weapon used, for the skin is stretched and
yields to a certain extent. Therefore the wound
might have been inflicted with long, slender
shears.”</p>

<p>Judith considered his answer in silence, a silence
which seemed endless to the busy surgeon.
Finally, with a glance at her and another at the
dial of the clock, he rose and picked up his bag.</p>

<p>“I must go, Judith,” he said. “Take my advice,
child, and lie down for a while. If you
don’t you will be added to my list of patients.
Please do as I ask you.”</p>

<p>Few could resist McLane’s charming smile, and
Judith’s “I will” was prompt. She experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>a strange reluctance to have him go, and only an
exertion of her self-control prevented her from
calling him back as she closed the front door on
his retreating figure. In her room Judith did her
best to comply with McLane’s request, but she
could not lie still on the bed. Finally, unable
longer to control her desire for motion, she got
up and wandered into the boudoir. From there
she went to her father’s den. He was not there,
and Judith with a glance into his bedroom, closed
the door, and, going over to his desk, she sat
down before it and went carefully through his
papers.</p>

<p>It was dusk, the early dusk of a winter afternoon
when Judith again entered the library.
Anna, the waitress, had not performed her usual
duties of turning on the electric lights, and Judith
contented herself with switching on the lamp nearest
her father’s safe. Dropping on her knees before
it, she propped a playing card on a stool
beside her, and, placing her hand on the knob of
the steel door, turned the dial. It was slow,
laborious work and perspiration trickled into
Judith’s eyes. She saw but dimly the Knave of
Hearts&mdash;the red of the playing card alone
showed up plainly. A last twist of her wrist and
the heavy steel door swung backward, and Judith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>sank down in a crouching position to rest her
cramped muscles.</p>

<p>She was still looking directly inside the safe
when a handkerchief was drawn across her eyes
and a hand detached the wire connecting her earphone
and the little electric battery which she wore
tucked inside her belt. Completely taken by surprise
and too paralyzed to move, Judith sat motionless
as the hand, having completed its mission,
slid around and covered her mouth. Then, before
she could scramble to her feet, hands dragged
her backward until she felt herself resting against
a table leg. It took but a moment to tie her to it;
the next instant a handkerchief gag replaced the
hand across her mouth.</p>

<p>For what seemed an eternity Judith sat without
motion, cut off from sound, from sight&mdash;</p>

<p>Surely the distorted silhouettes dancing before
her vision were creatures of her imagination!
Or could it be the shadows of real people seen
through the folds of the handkerchief?</p>

<p>Bound, blindfolded, gagged, deprived of her
earphone, and her hearing deadened by nature,
Judith’s heart was beating with suffocating rapidity.
She must get aid&mdash;aid before she fainted.
Instinctively she bit and worried her gag, and
the handkerchief, insecurely tied, parted finally.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>Judith filled her lungs with air, moistened her
parched lips, and tried to call for help.</p>

<p>The whispered cry reached only to the confines
of the room. To Judith’s ears no sound penetrated,
and she waited in agony. Had her shout
carried beyond the library? Surely the maids,
her father&mdash;some one must hear her?</p>

<p>She opened her mouth for another attempt, and
an oblong object was thrust between her teeth
and lashed around her head. Once again she was
left to herself. The excruciating pain produced
by the new gag caused Judith to clench her teeth
against it so as to relieve the pressure on the
strained flesh.</p>

<p>Judith had lost all track of time when suddenly
she felt the cords, binding her to the table leg,
loosened, and, as consciousness left her, she was
lifted upward, a dead weight.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">R</span>obert Hale</span> crossed the central hall
and entered the library with characteristic
haste. On finding only a solitary
light burning, he stopped and switched on the
other lamps until the library was flooded with
light.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed, catching sight of
Major Richards standing in front of the fireplace.
“Glad you are ready for dinner. It never fails,
Joe, if I am hungry, Mrs. Hale is always late.
She never has a well regulated appetite.”</p>

<p>Richards laughed. “Your wife told me not to
change into a dinner coat,” he explained, glancing
apologetically at his sack suit. “She said
we were so late in getting back from Walter Reed
Hospital that there was not time.”</p>

<p>“Beastly bore changing for dinner.” Hale
wandered aimlessly about the library. “Agatha
insists upon it, so”&mdash;a shrug completed the sentence.
“See that you imbue Judith with the idea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>that you are master, and you will enjoy future
peace of mind.”</p>

<p>“I cannot conceive of Judith’s ever requiring
a master,” retorted Richards, a trifle heatedly, and
Hale laughed.</p>

<p>“You are young and you haven’t been married
long,” he remarked indulgently. “Where’s
Judith?”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t come down yet.” Richards removed
his foot from the brass fire iron and stood
with his back to the mantel. “I plan to take
Judith to Palm Beach on Thursday.”</p>

<p>“You do, eh?” and Hale looked taken
aback.</p>

<p>“Yes,” steadily. “Judith is not strong.”</p>

<p>Hale did not reply. Instead, he scrutinized his
son-in-law from his well shod foot to the top of
his short cropped hair. There was an air of distinction,
of courage, in Richards’ carriage and in
his firm chin and clear eyes, eyes which did not
waver before Hale’s piercing glance.</p>

<p>“That is not a bad plan of yours,” Hale remarked
finally. “Perhaps Agatha and I will follow
you in a week or two. The fact is”&mdash;he
selected a chair near Richards&mdash;“Austin’s death
and the mystery surrounding it are getting on
every one’s nerves. It is demoralizing the household.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
The police&mdash;bah! they are incompetents.
They never see the obvious.”</p>

<p>“And what is the obvious, Mr. Hale?”</p>

<p>Hale hesitated and cast a doubtful look at his
son-in-law.</p>

<p>“The curious behavior of a certain female&mdash;”</p>

<p>Richards bent forward and stared at him, waiting
for the sentence to be completed.</p>

<p>“What female do you allude to?” he demanded
impatiently, breaking the pause.</p>

<p>The portières were pulled aside, and Anna, the
waitress, appeared, silver salver in hand.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Mr. Hale, but here is a telegram
for Miss Davis,” and she extended it to him.
“The messenger refused to take it to her house
address.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will see that it is forwarded.”
Hale put on his glasses, inspected the Western
Union envelope and its address, then laid the telegram
on the table. “Has Mr. John returned,
Anna?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” and Anna limped away to the pantry
by way of the dining room as Mrs. Hale
stepped between the portières in front of the doorway
leading to the central hall.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t say I am late, Robert,” she began.
“I have lost no time, and I do believe I am down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>before Judith,” with a quick glance about the
library. “What did you do with yourself this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Took a walk,” laconically. Hale drummed
his fingers on the chair, and Richards wondered
for the second time what made him so restless.
He had always an alertness of manner, but to
Richards it now appeared almost furtive. Hale
pointed to the clock. “Why do we have to wait
for Judith and John?” he demanded. “Suppose
we go in to dinner.”</p>

<p>Richards left his place by the mantel. “I’ll go
for Judith,” he volunteered. “I would have done
so before, Mrs. Hale; I but stopped in here on
our return, thinking she would come in every
minute.”</p>

<p>As he crossed the library, a door slammed in
the distance and heavy footsteps approached just
as Richards reached the portières. They were
dragged aside and he came face to face with John
Hale whose labored breathing indicated haste or
excitement, or both combined.</p>

<p>“So you are here!” John Hale exclaimed in
high satisfaction, and called over his shoulder,
“Come in, Ferguson. No, you don’t,” as Richards,
who had stepped back courteously to permit
him to advance into the library, started for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>hall. “You’ll stay here and face the music,” and
he thrust out his hand to push him back.</p>

<p>“Take your hands off my shoulder,” commanded
Richards, his anger rising both at his
words and action. “What do you wish with
me?”</p>

<p>“I wish you to explain in the presence of witnesses”&mdash;John
Hale cast a triumphant look at
his brother and sister-in-law before continuing&mdash;“how
you obtained this watch,” and, drawing it
out of his pocket, he swung it before Richards.</p>

<p>Richards looked first at the watch and then at
his questioner.</p>

<p>“It would be just as well if you first explained
how it came into your possession,” he remarked
quietly, and John Hale crimsoned.</p>

<p>“Don’t take that tone with me,” he exclaimed.
“I have the law behind me.”</p>

<p>“If the law is represented in the person of
Detective Ferguson, it is loitering directly back of
you,” broke in his brother who, with Mrs. Hale,
had drawn closer to the two angry men. “Come
in, Ferguson, don’t stand on the outskirts. My
brother is not really so formidable as he appears.”</p>

<p>Ferguson, who had purposely remained in the
background, an interested spectator of the scene,
flushed at Hale’s mocking tone and entered the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>library with some precipitancy. Hale watched
him in open amusement, then he turned to his
brother.</p>

<p>“Continue your remarks, John,” he directed.
“We are waiting.”</p>

<p>“I am addressing Major Richards and not
you,” retorted his brother. “Well, sir, what
about the watch?”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for an answer to my question,
Mr. Hale,” responded Richards.</p>

<p>“How I got the watch doesn’t concern you.”
John Hale spoke with more deliberation. “How
you obtained possession of Austin’s watch does
concern&mdash;the police.”</p>

<p>“Austin’s watch!” gasped Mrs. Hale.
“Good heavens!” She leaned nearer and inspected
it, taking care not to touch the watch.
“Where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“That is what I am asking Major Richards.
Perhaps he will be more courteous and answer
your question, as it is addressed by a woman”&mdash;and
John Hale looked scornfully at Richards.</p>

<p>“The gibe is unnecessary,” retorted the latter.
“As the watch is in your possession and not
in mine, it is up to you to explain how you got
it.”</p>

<p>Hale laughed outright. “He has you there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>John,” he chuckled. “Have you an answer
ready?”</p>

<p>Ignoring his brother, John Hale addressed himself
exclusively to Richards.</p>

<p>“Austin’s watch was sent to this house by Jennings,
the watchmaker, with whom you left it to
have the chain repaired. See, it bears your
name,” and he displayed the label still attached to
the watch. Richards read the words on it with
interest.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you to say?” demanded John
Hale, as he made no remark.</p>

<p>“That the watch bears my name does not prove
that I left the watch with this man, Jennings,”
Richards stated, and John Hale turned triumphantly
to the detective.</p>

<p>“There, didn’t I tell you he would take that
attitude?” he cried. “It won’t do, Richards.
Ferguson and I have just seen Jennings and he
described you accurately in giving an account of
the man who left the watch with him on Wednesday&mdash;mind
you, later in the same morning on
which Austin was found murdered. How did
you get possession of Austin’s watch?”</p>

<p>Richards looked steadily at the excited man before
him, at the others&mdash;noting instantly the
serious expression of Mrs. Hale’s countenance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>her husband’s intent interest, and Ferguson’s keen
attention. Then, slowly, he glanced around the
library&mdash;Judith was not present. He drew a
long breath.</p>

<p>“I decline to answer your question, Mr. Hale,”
he said.</p>

<p>Ferguson stepped forward. “It would be best,
Major, if you did,” he suggested. “That is a bit
of friendly advice.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” dryly. “Had you not better
warn me that anything I say will be used against
me?”</p>

<p>Hale chuckled, then grew serious. “Come,
John, what does this scene mean?” he demanded
of his brother. “What are you trying to
prove?”</p>

<p>“That Major Richards has a guilty knowledge
of, or is guilty of, Austin’s murder,” he replied,
and at his words a cry broke from Mrs. Hale and
she collapsed in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>Richards looked at John Hale in silence for a
brief second.</p>

<p>“So that is it,” he exclaimed. “I congratulate
you on your acumen. Now, perhaps you will tell
me why I murdered a man whom I had never
seen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, don’t,” wailed Mrs. Hale.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>“I found your name in Austin’s membership book
of his Senior secret society at Yale.”</p>

<p>Richards regarded her in surprise. “Certainly
my name is in the book; but I graduated at Yale
before Austin’s freshman year.”</p>

<p>John Hale smothered an oath. “Whether you
knew Austin or not is immaterial. When a man
is caught in the act of burglarizing a safe he
doesn’t need an introduction to the man who detects
him&mdash;he kills him&mdash;as you murdered
Austin.”</p>

<p>Richards shrugged his shoulder. “You will
have it that way,” he spoke with studied indifference,
as he again stole a look about the room&mdash;where
was Judith? “Has it ever occurred to
you that Austin might have been rifling Mr.
Hale’s safe and was killed in the act&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By whom?” gasped Mrs. Hale; her face was
ashen in color.</p>

<p>“I leave that conundrum to the police,” replied
Richards. “It was but a suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Which carries no weight,” retorted John
Hale. “This watch isn’t the only thing we have
on you, Richards.” He turned to his brother.
“What was stolen from your safe on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale’s sudden start was lost on her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
Hale looked at Richards queerly, thought
a minute, then answered with brevity.</p>

<p>“Ten bonds of the Troy Valve Company belonging
to Judith.”</p>

<p>“And those bonds, Richards, you sold to cover
your losses in speculation,” declared John Hale.</p>

<p>Richards contemplated the two brothers in
thunderstruck silence.</p>

<p>“You say that Judith had Valve bonds in your
safe which were stolen on Tuesday night, Mr.
Hale?” he demanded of the elder brother.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So it was your wife’s bonds which you first
stole and then sold”&mdash;John Hale was enjoying
himself. He had caught the hunted look in
Richards’ eyes. Turning, he winked at Ferguson,
and when he again faced Richards, the latter
had himself well in hand.</p>

<p>“You have stated twice now that I sold Valve
bonds,” Richards began. “It is up to you to
prove it.”</p>

<p>“And I can”&mdash;wheeling around, John Hale
seized the desk telephone and repeated a number.
A second more and he called into the instrument:</p>

<p>“John Hale speaking, Frank. Come over to
the house as quickly as you can. Polly&mdash;what
about Polly?&mdash;I don’t catch that&mdash;tell me when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>you get here,” and he banged up the receiver, then
turned to the others in the library. “It won’t
take Latimer five minutes to reach here.”</p>

<p>“And why is his presence required?” questioned
Richards. “It strikes me that this scene
has been prolonged unnecessarily.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, from your viewpoint.” John
Hale’s smile was not pleasant. “Don’t get nervous
at this stage of the game.”</p>

<p>Richards’ eyes blazed and he made a quick step
in his direction&mdash;to find the way blocked by
Detective Ferguson.</p>

<p>“None o’ that,” he exclaimed hastily. “Remember,
Mrs. Hale is present.”</p>

<p>Richards pulled himself together and his right
arm dropped to his side.</p>

<p>“I quite understand that Mr. John Hale is
aware that he has the protection of a woman’s
presence,” he remarked. Again Robert Hale
chuckled faintly, while his brother, coloring hotly,
had difficulty in curbing his unruly tongue. The
latter turned abruptly to his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Agatha, suppose you leave us,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I will not,” and Mrs. Hale, whose eyes were
twice their usual size, squared herself in her seat.
“I gather, John, I am needed here to keep you in
order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“Quite right, my dear,” and her husband patted
her approvingly on the back, before turning
to his brother. “Now, John, if you have any
more remarks to address to Major Richards, omit
all personalities or”&mdash;his voice deepened&mdash;“I
shall have to request you to leave the room.”</p>

<p>Ferguson caught the look that John Hale shot
at his brother and stepped gamely into the breach.
He had divined earlier in the investigation that
it took little to arouse the smoldering animosity
between the brothers.</p>

<p>“Major Richards,” he commenced, “you told
Coroner Penfield that you spent Tuesday evening
at the Metropolitan Club. At what hour did you
leave the club for home?”</p>

<p>Richards considered the question. “It was
just midnight,” he stated. “I am positive as to
the time for the clocks were chiming when I left
the building, and I waited and counted the strokes&mdash;twelve
of them.”</p>

<p>The detective consulted a page in his notebook.
“You also told the coroner that you reached here
about twenty minutes past one on Wednesday
morning. Where did you stop between here and
the club?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere.”</p>

<p>Ferguson eyed him intently. “The club is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>about fifteen minutes walk from here, at the outside,”
he declared. “Do you contend that it took
you over an hour to reach this house?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” quietly. “Your circles and avenues
are confusing and I lost my way.”</p>

<p>John Hale laughed aloud. “A great alibi,” he
sneered. “Austin was murdered between Tuesday
midnight and one <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Wednesday&mdash;thus
you had ample time to reach here, kill him, leave
the house and return a few minutes after one
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” Richards shrugged his
shoulders disdainfully. “Well, prove it.”</p>

<p>“I will.” John Hale waved his walking stick
which he had brought with him into the library in
his haste to encounter Richards. “And here’s
one link in the chain now,” as Frank Latimer was
ushered in by Anna, the waitress, whose curious
glance at the excited group escaped notice.
“Frank, did Major Richards sell ten bonds of
the Troy Valve Company in your office on Friday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“He did.” The little stockbroker stared at
each in turn, and the gravity of their expression
was reflected in his manner.</p>

<p>“Did Judith call there that same afternoon?”
Richards’ violent start was seen by all, and John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>Hale’s eyes gleamed viciously as he continued his
questions. “Did she tell you that she owned ten
bonds of the Troy Valve Company, numbering
from 37982 to 37991?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And did those numbers correspond with the
numbers on the bonds sold you by Major Richards?”</p>

<p>“They did.”</p>

<p>John Hale turned to his brother.  “You have a
memorandum of Judith’s bonds which were stolen
from your safe on Tuesday night,” he stated.
“Repeat the numbers.”</p>

<p>There was a slight hesitation in Hale’s manner
before he complied with his brother’s abrupt request.
Opening his leather wallet, he found a
memorandum and ran his eye down it.</p>

<p>“The numbers are the same,” he said, and
replaced his wallet.</p>

<p>“Well, Richards, have you anything to say?”
demanded John Hale, and edged nearer him.</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;to you,” and John Hale flushed at
his cutting tone.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll have something to say to me,
Major,” broke in Detective Ferguson. “Will
you tell us how you got those bonds?”</p>

<p>Richards eyed the little group; his gaze rested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>longest on Robert Hale, then he turned to Ferguson,
as the detective repeated his question.</p>

<p>“No,” he responded. “I will not tell you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale leaned forward and placed a trembling
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Did Judith give you the bonds?” she asked
timidly.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Hale, she did not,” and Richards,
catching her pitying look, felt a sudden tightening
of his heartstrings. It was the first expression
of sympathy vouchsafed him. Where&mdash;where
was Judith?</p>

<p>Ferguson broke the brief pause.</p>

<p>“Major Richards,” he began, and Mrs. Hale
clutched her chair in her excitement. Her head
felt heavy, her breathing stifled&mdash;Dr. McLane
had warned her about a weak heart. “You have
heard Mr. Latimer, a reputable witness, testify
that you sold bonds belonging to your wife, and
Mr. Hale, your father-in-law, has stated that those
bonds were stolen from his safe on Tuesday night.
You declare that you left the Metropolitan Club
on Tuesday at midnight, and that you lost your
way and spent an hour walking about the streets
before reaching this house at twenty minutes past
one o’clock on Wednesday morning. Can you
substantiate that statement with witnesses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot.” Richards’ gaze was unwavering
and his voice firm, but his face was white and
strained. “I met no one while walking home.
That was the chief reason for my delay, because
I had no opportunity to ask the right direction to
take. I have no sense of locality.”</p>

<p>“Humph, very pretty!” commented John Hale,
and Detective Ferguson scowled at him.</p>

<p>“I’m handling this case, Mr. Hale.” He spoke
harshly, and John Hale showed instant resentment
by returning the scowl as the detective again
addressed Richards. “You left the watch belonging
to the murdered man, Austin Hale, with
Jennings to repair. That is conclusive evidence
that the watch had been in your possession.”</p>

<p>“So you claim”&mdash;and Richards smiled politely.
“Don’t let me interrupt your little romance,
Ferguson. Go on.”</p>

<p>Ferguson swallowed his wrath. “I am stating
facts, Major, facts which have been proved.
Once more I’ll give you a chance to state your
version of how Austin’s watch came into your
possession, and the Valve bonds as well.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Richards’ brows were knit in a
deep frown. “Do I understand that I am your
prisoner?”</p>

<p>Ferguson drew out a legal document. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>have this warrant for your arrest,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Then I will reserve what I have to say until I
see a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“But, Major&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, Ferguson,” firmly. “A prisoner’s right
to consult a lawyer is a constitutional right.”</p>

<p>“Prisoner!” Mrs. Hale started from her
chair. “Robert&mdash;”</p>

<p>Robert Hale stepped forward. “Sit down,
Agatha.” He pushed her gently back in her
chair before turning to Ferguson. “Who swore
out that warrant?”</p>

<p>“Your brother, Mr. John Hale.”</p>

<p>“So”&mdash;Hale faced his brother. “Have
you forgotten our conversation early this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I have not.” John Hale shouldered Latimer
to one side as he stepped nearer the center of the
room. “You tried to fasten Austin’s murder
on an innocent girl to shield your daughter’s
husband.”</p>

<p>“An innocent girl!” Hale’s mocking smile
brought his brother’s rage to fever heat. “So
innocent that when she quarreled with her lover at
their midnight meeting she killed him with her
shears&mdash;shears which I had bought for her the
week before.” Swiftly he turned to Ferguson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>“Release Major Richards and arrest the real
criminal, Polly Davis.”</p>

<p>An oath broke from John Hale, and in blind
fury he twirled his walking stick. His brother,
by a dexterous twist only, avoided the thrust.
As the steel point of the sword cane came to
rest directly under the powerful light from a
standing reading lamp, a scream escaped Mrs.
Hale.</p>

<p>“Look, look!” she cried. “It’s covered with
blood.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNSEEN EAR</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> if hypnotized, John Hale stared at his
sword cane, raising it slowly, very
slowly, then as slowly dropped the point
and gazed at his brother.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> blood,” he gasped. “But you are unhurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Robert Hale’s voice was not quite
steady. “You did not reach me.”</p>

<p>“Then where did this blood come from?” demanded
John Hale. “It’s&mdash;it’s not <i>fresh</i>,” and
there was a growing horror in the look he cast at
his companions.</p>

<p>Ferguson, who had followed every act and
word with rapt attention, picked up the bamboo
cane casing which John Hale had tossed to the
floor when he drew the concealed weapon and
lunged at his brother. Stepping up to the dazed
man, the detective took the sword from his unresisting
hand and examined it with interest.</p>

<p>“Austin Hale was killed by a rapier-like
thrust,” he stated slowly. “The autopsy proved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>that the wound was greater in depth than in
length. Is this your cane, Mr. Hale?”</p>

<p>John Hale wet his dry lips. “It is,” he
muttered, and looked dumbly at his silent, motionless
companions.</p>

<p>“You carry it always?” asked Ferguson with
dogged persistence.</p>

<p>“When I go out, yes.”</p>

<p>“Who knows that this ordinary-appearing
bamboo cane conceals a rapier?”</p>

<p>“My brother.” John Hale avoided looking at
them, his eyes were still on the sword cane.</p>

<p>“Any one else?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure?” and Ferguson tried to meet
his eye.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes.” With an effort John Hale recovered
some semblance of his usual manner. “I
may have spoken of the cane but I don’t recall
doing so. I bought it from an antique dealer
and it’s been a fad of mine to carry it.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Ferguson considered him steadily
for a moment. “Where were you on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>“At the French Embassy reception.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hale,”&mdash;the detective spoke her name
with such sharpness that she jumped involuntarily&mdash;“was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
your brother-in-law with you at the Embassy
between midnight Tuesday and one o’clock
Wednesday morning?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale looked at no one in particular and
wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“Must I answer?” she begged, turning imploringly
to her husband and, as she caught his
expression, exclaimed: “No, I refuse to.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put yourself out for me, Agatha.”
There was a sudden utter weariness in John Hale’s
tone, and Richards started and looked at him intently.
What did it portend? “I will answer
your question, Ferguson. I was not at the
French Embassy during that time.”</p>

<p>“Where were you?”</p>

<p>There was a tense silence. When John Hale
answered he spoke hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p>“I had returned to this house to meet my stepson,
Austin.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale collapsed. “Oh, dear! oh, dear,
I’ve feared it all along,” she wailed, and burst
into tears. “Oh, Polly, Polly, you have a lot
to answer for!”</p>

<p>“Have I?” asked a strained voice, and Polly
Davis, who had been a stunned witness of the
scene, advanced a few steps further into the room,
Anna, the waitress, peering over her shoulder with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>wide, curious eyes. “Well, I am here to face the
consequences.”</p>

<p>John Hale, who had not taken his eyes from
her ghastly face, sprang to her side.</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed vehemently. “No.
Go home.”</p>

<p>“Presently,” she silenced him with an imperative
gesture, before turning to the detective.</p>

<p>“Whom do you accuse of the murder of Austin
Hale?” she asked.</p>

<p>Ferguson scratched a bewildered head. “I
did believe Major Richards guilty,” he admitted
slowly. “But seeing that Mr. Hale states he
came back here to meet his stepson, that Austin
was killed at that time with a rapier thrust, and
that Mr. Hale’s sword cane has bloodstains on
it&mdash;” He paused. “Well, taking all that into
consideration and with the knowledge that he and
Austin were not on good terms&mdash;I guess&mdash;it
looks as if Mr. Hale killed him.”</p>

<p>Polly drew a long, painful breath. “Wait,”
she cautioned. “I was here on Tuesday night.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” commanded John, a look of agony
on his strong face.</p>

<p>“No, I must speak.” Polly partly turned
from him and addressed the others. “I wrote
Austin on Saturday breaking our engagement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>but as Monday was Washington’s Birthday he
never received the letter until Tuesday morning.
In answer I had a wire from Austin stating that
he would get here Tuesday about midnight.
I”&mdash;her voice quivered a bit, then steadied&mdash;“it
was imperative that I see him without delay,
so I came, admitting myself with Mrs. Hale’s
latchkey which I had borrowed one day last week.
I walked into the library”&mdash;she caught her
breath.</p>

<p>“Stop, Polly,” pleaded John Hale. “Stop.
You don’t know what you are saying.” Seeing
that she paid no attention to his words, he appealed
to the detective. “For God’s sake tell
her to stop&mdash;it’s not fair&mdash;it’s cruel&mdash;she shall
not convict herself.”</p>

<p>“What are you insinuating?” cried Polly.
“Convict myself? Are you mad? Austin was
stabbed before I entered this house.”</p>

<p>The five men eyed each other in silence, then
concentrated their attention upon her, forgetful
of Mrs. Hale, of Anna&mdash;waiting for her to continue.</p>

<p>“I saw Austin lying on the floor,” she went
on, her voice husky with emotion. “The shock
made me cry out, then my whole impulse was to
run, to hide. I reached the central hall and paused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>to gather strength; a faint noise on the staircase
caused me to look in that direction and I made
out dimly a man peering at me over the bannisters”&mdash;
She paused. “Mr. Robert Hale, why
are you using a dictograph in this house?”</p>

<p>Hale looked at her in dumb surprise&mdash;twice
he opened his lips to speak and twice closed them
with the words unspoken. Richards, standing
somewhat in the background, bent forward in a
listening attitude.</p>

<p>“What’s that noise?” he demanded.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>Through the silence came a faint drumming, it
grew louder, then died away, to break out again
a little louder, more insistently.</p>

<p>“By heavens, it comes from the alcove!” exclaimed
Richards, and racing across the room,
he dashed aside the heavy red satin curtains pulled
across it. A horrified exclamation escaped him,
and he recoiled at sight of Judith, bound and
gagged, lying on the window seat. Her body had
slipped down the piled up sofa cushions and her
right foot just touched the paneled wall and with
it she was beating the devil’s tattoo.</p>

<p>“Good God!” gasped Richards, then recovering
himself, tore at her fastenings. Ferguson,
more clear-headed than the other, slashed at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>clothes’ line which bound her with John Hale’s
sword cane, and aided him in carrying her to a
chair by the table.</p>

<p>“Chafe her arms and ankles so that the blood
will circulate,” he advised, while his nimble fingers
untied the cord holding the fan, which had been
thrust into her mouth as a gag.</p>

<p>Judith, who had watched their efforts in silent
agony, raised her cramped arms and massaged the
stiffened muscles of her mouth and jaw; then
she replaced the wires connecting her earphone
and its battery.</p>

<p>“In God’s name who has treated you so,
Judith?” demanded Richards, his eyes were blazing
with rage. “Who has dared to&mdash;” and he
choked.</p>

<p>“Fetch my smelling salts,” Judith spoke with
some difficulty and paused eagerly to drink the
water offered her by Frank Latimer. “No, don’t
go, Anna,” placing her hand on the waitress’
shoulder as she knelt at her side chafing her
ankles. “Ring for Maud.”</p>

<p>Her father complied with her request, then
returned to Judith. For the first time he looked
old and haggard.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of all this?” he demanded,
with a return of his domineering manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>Judith looked at her husband for a fleeting
second, then addressed Detective Ferguson whose
attention was focused on her.</p>

<p>“I have a confession to make to you,” she
began. “You recall finding the bloodstained
shears near Austin’s body?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, as she paused.</p>

<p>“I used them.”</p>

<p>“Judith!” Richards sprang forward with an
imploring gesture, but for once his wife ignored
him.</p>

<p>“I used them,” she reiterated, “to remove a
locket from Austin’s watch chain when I found
him lying dead in this library. That locket,”
she paused to take the smelling salts which Maud
who had hurriedly entered a second before handed
to her,&mdash;“that locket Polly Davis stole from my
bedroom last night with other jewelry.”</p>

<p>No one spoke, and Judith, resting one hand on
Anna’s shoulder and the other on Maud’s arm,
rose stiffly to her feet.</p>

<p>“Late this afternoon,” Judith continued, “I
was examining Father’s safe,”&mdash;Hale started
violently&mdash;“when some one stole behind me,
blindfolded me, disconnected my earphone, and
gagged me.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on,” urged Detective Ferguson,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>forgetting, in his interest, his usual respectful
manner.</p>

<p>“I was gagged,” repeated Judith, “with my
fan. The thief did not know that this fan”&mdash;she
raised it as she spoke&mdash;“is an ear trumpet
which when pressed against my teeth enables me
to hear distinctly.”</p>

<p>Her right hand moved upward with a sweeping
motion, and Maud, the parlor maid, was
shorn of her cap and wig.</p>

<p>Ferguson recovered from his stupefaction in
time to trip and catch the flying figure.</p>

<p>“Jim Turner,” he gasped, as the handcuffs
slipped over the wrists of the erstwhile maid.
“I’ve been looking for you for five years.”</p>

<p>“And you have found the murderer of Austin
Hale,” ended Judith.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> stunned silence the little group eyed Detective
Ferguson and his prisoner. Slowly
the latter rose from his hands and knees, the
handcuffs clinking musically as he knocked against
Ferguson’s left wrist to which he was secured.</p>

<p>“Easy,” cautioned Ferguson, and the revolver
in his right hand menaced the murderer. “You’ll
get no chance to escape now, Jim,” with emphasis,
then with reluctant admiration as he scanned
Turner’s good-looking effeminate features and
his slight trim figure in its woman’s costume.
“Say, but you are a pretty girl. I never once
suspected you, never.”</p>

<p>“And I’d have kept you fooled,” retorted
Turner, “except for you,” addressing Judith.
“You were one too many for me with those cursed
unseen ears,” and he cast a look of baffled fury
at her fan. “I thought you were practically dead
to the world when I disconnected that blamed
earphone and blindfolded you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“You put too much confidence in your own
cleverness,” Judith responded. “It would have
been wiser if you and your confederate had ransacked
Father’s safe in silence, instead of discussing
your desperate need, on account of Austin’s
murder, of getting away&mdash;and thus giving me a
clew to your identity.”</p>

<p>“Who is your confederate?” demanded Ferguson.
A scowl was his only answer. “Oh, well,
you’ll talk more later,” with significant emphasis,
“in the Death House.”</p>

<p>Turner’s face was distorted with rage. “To
think I’ll have to swing for that hound, Austin
Hale!” he stormed. “He welshed on every one,
the yellow dog.”</p>

<p>“What was your motive for killing him?”
asked Robert Hale, recovering from his stupefied
surprise at the course of events.</p>

<p>Turner looked at him in silence for a minute,
then at the others in the library. Their concentrated
regard fanned his inordinate vanity and&mdash;in
spite of Ferguson’s words, the Death House
seemed remote.</p>

<p>“Why did I kill Austin Hale? Because he penetrated
my disguise.” He paused, then continued
more rapidly. “It must have been shortly before
midnight when I was going to bed&mdash;every one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>else had retired and I could hear Anna and the
cook snoring in their rooms,”&mdash;Anna’s face was
a study as she glared at the man she had known
as “Maud”&mdash;“and I supposed I had locked my
bedroom door. I was shaving&mdash;had to do it at
dead of night,” he interpolated, “when in the
glass I saw the hall door open a little way and
Austin Hale peered into the room. I was too
paralyzed to turn round and he stared at my reflection
in the glass, then, collecting himself, he
softly closed the door and silently stole away.”</p>

<p>No one cared to break the silence as Turner
ceased speaking, a second more and he had resumed
his statement.</p>

<p>“I wiped the shaving lather off my face,
straightened my wig and crept down the hall. I
heard Austin moving about in his room and I
went back, but I could not stay there. I don’t
know now what brought Austin to my door at
that hour, unless he wanted me to aid him in seeing
Miss Polly Davis, but he had raised the devil
in me. It wouldn’t take him long to establish my
identity and then would follow exposure, and that
meant, with my record, doing fully fifteen years
in the penitentiary.”</p>

<p>“Better that than swinging for murder,” commented
Ferguson dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>“Not as I felt then,” retorted Turner. “My
brain was on fire as I stole downstairs and trailed
him to the library. On the way I saw Mr. John
Hale’s sword cane in the umbrella stand. I’d
seen him open it once or twice to show to Miss
Polly.” Ferguson shot a look at Polly and John
Hale. They had drawn close to each other and
stood listening breathlessly to Turner’s story.</p>

<p>“So some one beside your brother knew about
your sword cane, Mr. Hale,” Ferguson remarked
with a quizzical smile, and John Hale nodded.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Turner,” he said, and the prisoner,
with a resentful glare at Detective Ferguson,
again addressed them, confining his remarks almost
exclusively to Judith.</p>

<p>“I knew how to work the spring of the sword
cane, for I had played with it several times when
Mr. John left it behind, and so I picked up the
cane on Tuesday night and stole into the dining
room.” In spite of himself, Turner’s voice was
not quite steady. It quivered and deepened as he
lived over again the events of that fateful night.</p>

<p>“I intended to peek through the portières into
the library, for not hearing a sound in there
puzzled me. The portières were parted a wee bit
and I made out Miss Judith sitting at the far
end before the fireplace with her back partly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>turned toward me. Then”&mdash;his voice changed,
holding a note of horror&mdash;“Austin Hale loomed
up before me, right under the sidelight. I could
have touched his shirt-bosom, instead&mdash;My God!
I lunged and the sword cane struck home.”</p>

<p>“I heard Austin fall,” Turner resumed after
a tense pause, “and instinctively tiptoed to the
pantry and crouched there in the dark. I heard
you come in, Major, and Miss Judith call to you.
Then after what seemed an interminable time I
crept out into the central hall, found it deserted,
and replaced the cane in the umbrella stand.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go at all into the library?” demanded
Robert Hale harshly.</p>

<p>“Yes, after Miss Polly had been there.” He
cast a vicious look in the girl’s direction. “I
heard some one sobbing in the library as I started
to leave the pantry and peeked in again in time
to see you wringing your hands over Austin’s
body&mdash;you are a weak sister to sob over the man
who threatened you with exposure.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;” John Hale started forward, but
Major Richards’ tall figure blocked him. “Get
out of my way, I’ll throttle that fellow.”</p>

<p>“Not here, you won’t,” interposed Ferguson.
“Keep quiet, Mr. Hale, until Turner completes
his confession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“Tell him to speak more respectfully of Miss
Davis&mdash;or not mention her at all,” thundered
John Hale.</p>

<p>“What happened next?” demanded his brother.
“Shut up, John,” and he waved him back.
“What did Miss Davis do next, Turner?”</p>

<p>“Cleared out,” succinctly, “first taking a look
at the sword cane standing so innocently in the
umbrella stand.” Turner’s chuckle was unpleasant.
“That left the coast clear for me and I
slipped into the library. There the open safe attracted
me,” with a side-long glance at Hale. “I
had picked up my rubber gloves, used in my house
work, when in the pantry and I put ’em on. The
open safe was too good a chance to overlook, but
I only had time to grab a few bonds and a memorandum
which Austin had been looking at”&mdash;a
gasp escaped Mrs. Hale&mdash;“then I beat it up the
back stairs to my room, for I heard some one
coming down. I guess it was you, Major.”</p>

<p>“It was,” acknowledged Richards. He cast a
hesitating look at Judith before continuing. “I
did lose my way, as I have already stated, when
walking home, and I entered the front door just
in time to catch Judith as she fainted. I immediately
carried her upstairs and laid her on the
couch in our boudoir. I had some cognac there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>and quickly revived her.” He paused for a
second. “The reading lamp was burning in the
boudoir and I concluded that Judith had come
downstairs feeling faint and in search of some
medicine which, I recalled, had been left in the
library. When she revived, she said nothing to
me about having gone downstairs, and when I
asked her if she needed her medicine, she replied
that she did.”</p>

<p>“Please wait, Joe,” Judith interrupted him
quickly. “I was dazed&mdash;completely unnerved.
In fact I had at the time no recollection of fainting
in the hall. I thought, until you questioned
me the other night, that you had found me unconscious
in the boudoir, so I never mentioned that
after Mother and Uncle John left for the French
Embassy I went down into the library to read and
wait for you, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Your silence confused me, puzzled me,”
Richards confessed. “In fact&mdash;well, you will
understand when I tell you that a gold locket fell
out of your belt when I unloosened it. As I
picked up the locket and placed it by your side
on the couch I saw that a gold link fastened to
its ring had been forced apart. A few minutes
later I went into the library and discovered Austin
lying dead on the floor.” He turned to Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>Hale. “In stating that I did not know Austin,
I told the truth, but I had seen a photograph of
him that morning on Judith’s dressing table and
the photograph bore his autograph. I was horrified
at finding his dead body, and that horror was
intensified when, on bending closer, I discovered
that a link in his watch chain was bent and twisted&mdash;and
the link attached to the locket tucked in
Judith’s belt had come unmistakably from that
chain.”</p>

<p>“Merciful heavens!” Judith gazed at him in
horror. “Then you thought&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The obvious,” responded Richards. “Your
mother had told me that there had been a boy and
girl affair between you, that they confidently expected
an engagement on your return from
Japan&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mother!” Mrs. Hale quailed under Judith’s
anger.</p>

<p>“Upon my soul, Judith, you need not take
that tone with me,” she objected. “The first
intimation we had of your marriage to Joe was a
cable announcing it. A nice way to treat parents
who had indulged every whim.”</p>

<p>“Need we go into that again, Mother?” protested
Judith.</p>

<p>“No; but I was hurt, deeply hurt, and I did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>not take kindly to having a son-in-law thrust on
us.”</p>

<p>“And so you took it out on him by repeating
a lot of nonsense,” exclaimed her husband indignantly.
“Well, Richards, I suppose you concluded
that Judith and Austin quarreled and she
had stabbed him, and reached the hall in a fainting
condition just as you entered the house?”</p>

<p>“Exactly, sir; Judith’s silence about Austin&mdash;for
that she had seen him either dead or alive was
proved by her possession of the locket, led me to
fear a frightful tragedy,” admitted Richards.
“In my agony of mind I did the only thing that
occurred to me, I took the watch and chain out of
Austin’s vest pocket before sending for the
coroner, for I knew it was a clew the police would
trace to the bitter end.”</p>

<p>“But why did you send the watch to Jennings?”
asked Hale. “It was courting discovery.”</p>

<p>“As it turned out, yes; but my idea was that if
the chain was repaired no one would suspect a
locket had been wrenched from it,” explained
Richards. “Then it would not have mattered
where the watch was found.”</p>

<p>Hale shook his head. “You laid yourself open
to grave suspicion,” he said. “I now understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>your actions and your constrained manner, but&mdash;”
He stopped. “I missed a playing card out of my
solitaire pack several days ago, a Knave of Hearts,
to be exact, on which I had scratched the combination
of my safe.”</p>

<p>“Robert!” The ejaculation came from Mrs.
Hale and her husband turned to her testily.</p>

<p>“I am troubled with amnesia,” he said. “It
is just a touch, but I am sensitive about having
it known or suspected, and so occasionally I jot
down figures and numbers. I play solitaire so
continuously that I am never without the safe-combination;
but on Friday I missed the card and
the next day asked Maud, or shall we say Jim
Turner,”&mdash;and he indicated the pseudo-maid&mdash;“if
she had seen the card. She brought it to me
later, stating that she had found it on your
dresser, Richards, and it led me to believe that
you had a hand in Austin’s murder.”</p>

<p>“Is that why you put a dictograph in our
boudoir?” asked Richards.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Hale admitted. “I went to the Burroughs
Agency, explained my suspicions, and they
installed it.”</p>

<p>Polly Davis broke her long silence. “I heard
you talking to Mr. Burroughs,” she explained.
“I went to the detective agency to ask them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>undertake an investigation for me, but your presence,
Mr. Hale, frightened me away.” She
paused and looked at Judith and her father.
“From having seen you on the stairs Tuesday
night, Mr. Hale, I began to suspect that you might
have killed Austin. I knew that you and he had
often quarreled in the past&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How about John’s scenes with his stepson?”
inquired Hale dryly, and Polly changed color,
but she ignored his question as she went bravely
on.</p>

<p>“Your offer to increase my salary and your unsolicited
loan, Judith, increased my suspicion,”
she stated. “I thought that you were trying to
bribe me. Then your threat about the locket&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What was in the locket?” asked Richards
and his father-in-law simultaneously.</p>

<p>Polly looked swiftly at John Hale and then
away. She was deadly white.</p>

<p>“Last week,” she began, “I had a letter from
Austin in which he said that rumors had reached
him of my infatuation for”&mdash;she stammered,
then went bravely on&mdash;“for his stepfather, that
if I permitted John to make love to me he would
show him a letter I had written. It was a piece
of sheer folly, but”&mdash;her voice trembled&mdash;“the
letter was compromising. Austin stated that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>kept the letter in a locket I had given him and
would bring them both to Washington.”</p>

<p>“What followed?” asked Mrs. Hale, more
absorbed in Polly’s tale than in all else.</p>

<p>“I wrote Austin that I did not fear his threat
and broke our engagement.” The girl paused.
“I have already told you that Austin wired he
would be here Tuesday night. I heard that Mrs.
Hale and John were going to the French Embassy,
I knew that Mr. Hale was ill in bed, and so I
came here that night on impulse, trusting to
chance to see Austin alone and persuade him to
destroy the letter. The murderer,” she shuddered,
“has testified that I entered the house after he
had killed Austin.” She turned abruptly to
Judith. “What was your object in taking the
locket?”</p>

<p>“My desire to shield you,” Judith answered.
“Austin wrote me at the same time he did you,
telling of the existence of such a letter, and that
he carried it in a locket to have it in instant readiness.
I had no idea that he would be here Tuesday
night, and when I found his body as I started
to leave the library, I jumped to the conclusion,
Polly, that you had killed him and in terror had
run away without securing the locket.”</p>

<p>“Would it not have been easier for you to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>taken the watch and chain as well?” asked
Richards.</p>

<p>“I feared that if the watch were missing search
would be made for it,” she explained.
“Whereas, if only Polly and I knew about the
locket it would not be missed. I had Polly’s
shears in my sewing bag, having picked them up
when in Father’s den early Tuesday afternoon.
I dropped them after securing the locket, and
afterwards came down into the library to get them
and found Joe talking to Coroner Penfield and
Mr. Ferguson.”</p>

<p>“Polly,”&mdash;Robert Hale’s sudden pronouncement
of her name made the girl start nervously&mdash;“why
did you supply Austin with the combination
of my safe?”</p>

<p>“I did not give it to him,” she denied indignantly.</p>

<p>“Indeed? Then why did you write this cryptic
message, ‘Saw Austin-10-t-b-53-76c,’ over
and over on a page of copied manuscript?” and
Hale held out the sheet he had shown his brother
earlier that day.</p>

<p>Polly stared at it. “My mind was far from my
work,” she stammered. “I wrote mechanically
on the typewriter any silly sentences that came into
my head. I did know your safe-combination,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>for you had me write it down for you once and
the figures dwelt in my memory; but indeed I did
not repeat them to Austin.”</p>

<p>“You did not need to,” broke in Mrs. Hale.
“I had Austin once open the safe for me, Robert,
in your absence. I needed my jewelry, and I
supposed he remembered the combination or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or jotted it down for future use,” Turner
interrupted her brusquely. “I found a soiled
bit of paper with several numbers torn off on
Austin’s bureau when I slipped in his bedroom
on my way to bed. He must have refreshed his
memory before going down to the library by
studying the paper.”</p>

<p>“What was he searching for in the safe?”
asked Hale.</p>

<p>“I know,” volunteered Mrs. Hale. She stared
anywhere but at her husband. “Austin had very
wheedling ways, and sometimes when he was hard
pressed for money, he persuaded me to lend it to
him.”</p>

<p>“Agatha!”</p>

<p>“I know, Robert, it was foolish.” Mrs. Hale’s
voice trembled with a suspicion of tears. “The
sum finally totaled four thousand seven hundred
and eighty-two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” and Hale eyed her in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“I had his memorandum of his indebtedness,”
she went on, paying no attention to her husband.
“I wrote reminding him of it, and that I had
placed it in your safe intending to show it to
you, Robert&mdash;” Hale groaned dismally and his
wife burst into tears. “I dared not ask outright
about the memorandum as I feared it might
be suspected that Austin and I had quarreled over
it.”</p>

<p>Judith broke in upon any reproaches her father
might have made.</p>

<p>“It was to solve Austin’s reason for opening
your safe, Father, that caused me to search it
this afternoon in hopes of finding a clew,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the combination?”</p>

<p>“From your playing card,” she explained. “I
knew your absent-minded habits and recalled seeing
some pin scratches on the Knave of Hearts
which, by the way, I picked up in this library
Friday night and later placed on top of my husband’s
pack, thinking, as the back of the cards
were similar, it belonged to him. So this afternoon
after Dr. McLane left I could not rest, the
card recurred to me, and I searched my husband’s
pack. Not finding it, I went to your den and discovered
it among your papers. I had just opened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>the safe when Maud”&mdash;catching herself up&mdash;“that
man, blindfolded me.”</p>

<p>“And what induced you to tempt providence
again, Turner?” demanded Ferguson turning to
his prisoner. “You might have escaped detection
but for that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the sullen answer. “I knew
Mr. Hale had deposited negotiable bonds and a
large sum of money there over Sunday&mdash;”</p>

<p>Judith interrupted him with an exclamation.
“Did you steal my Valve bonds on Tuesday
night?”</p>

<p>Turner nodded. “It was all I did get.” His
bitter chuckle was brief. “I was well scared
after the murder but I dared not bolt for fear
of centering suspicion upon me, and then I had
no money. I nosed around everywhere looking
for something I could steal to raise ready cash.
I was afraid to dispose of Miss Judith’s bonds
because it might have been traced to me. In my
search I found Miss Polly had brought some
bonds in an envelope and when she was with Mrs.
Hale I sneaked it out.”</p>

<p>“You did?” Polly looked at him in round-eyed
surprise. “But I found the bonds there.”</p>

<p>“Sure you did,” again Turner chuckled, “but
they weren’t <i>your</i> Valve bonds, but Miss Judith’s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>I noticed they were the same, so I substituted
hers in your envelope, knowing that I could sell
yours without danger of the numbers’ being traced
to Austin’s murder.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but,” Polly turned in perplexity to
Richards. “Then the Valve bonds I asked you
to sell for me Friday afternoon were Judith’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, evidently,” Richards addressed Frank
Latimer. “I gave Miss Polly my check for her
bonds before going to your brokerage office where
I sold the bonds to you and put up the cash to
cover my margins with you.” Before the stockbroker
could answer him, Richards looked at Polly
searchingly. “Tell us, Miss Polly, how you contrived
to steal the jewelry out of Judith’s bedroom
last night when she and I were sitting in
the boudoir&mdash;the only entrance to the inner
room?”</p>

<p>The girl was slow in answering. “After
Judith left me last night, I was desperate,” she
admitted finally. “I feared the locket would be
used to entangle me in the murder, if not convict
me of the crime, and I decided to steal it at all
costs. I took all your jewelry&mdash;which, by the
way, has been mailed back to you registered post,
Judith&mdash;thinking that the theft would then be
attributed to an ordinary sneak thief. As to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>how I passed you unobserved in entering your
bedroom”&mdash;for the first time Polly smiled&mdash;“some
scientific detectives would describe it as
a case of psychological invisibility, where the
physical eye sees, but the brain fails to record the
eye’s message, but”&mdash;again she smiled&mdash;“you
and Major Richards were so absorbed in each
other that you never noticed me when I slipped
through the boudoir and out again.”</p>

<p>A rich color suffused Judith’s cheeks. “Did
the locket contain your letter, Polly?” she asked.
“Or was Austin’s threat an idle one? I”&mdash;with
a quick proud lift of her head&mdash;“never examined
the locket.”</p>

<p>Polly opened her hand bag to which she had
clung ever since entering the library, and took out
the locket. She held it up that all might see the
slightly raised lettering of the word “Mizpah,”
then without a word she pressed a spring and
from the locket took a many folded thin sheet of
note paper. She spread it open and laid it in
John Hale’s hand.</p>

<p>“This is a letter of a foolish, indiscreet girl,
longing for a little attention, a little of this
world’s fun,” she said soberly. “I was caught
by the dross, and it was not until I grew to know
you, John, that I found pure gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>John Hale looked at her and then at the letter.</p>

<p>“Austin telephoned me from New York to meet
him here on Tuesday at midnight and to say
nothing to any one of his expected arrival,” he
stated. “He intimated that he had an important
disclosure to make about you. I left Agatha at
the French Embassy, and I had just reached the
corner when I saw you, Polly, dash down the steps
and go up the street. I started to overtake you,
then turned back. I could not make up my mind
to face Austin then, for I knew I would kill
him,” John’s hands clenched and unclenched
spasmodically. “Finally, I returned to the Embassy
for Agatha and when we walked in here I
was confronted with Austin’s dead body. I imagined
you had seen him, Polly, and goaded by
threats had stabbed him, for I recognized the
shears as ones I had seen on your desk in Robert’s
den.”</p>

<p>John stopped speaking and looked down at the
letter still clutched in his extended hand, then
striding swiftly to the fireplace he threw the unread
letter on the blazing wood. As it ignited
and flared into a blaze, he turned with outstretched
hands to Polly who had watched him
in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p>“Polly,” he began, and his voice quivered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>emotion, “will you take me, for better, for
worse?”</p>

<p>Polly’s eyes were blinded with tears, but winking
them away, she looked bravely up at him.</p>

<p>“Will <i>you</i> take a repentant, adoring fool?”
she asked, and John Hale’s low cry of happiness
found echo in her heart as, regardless of the
others, he slipped his arm about her and led her
from the library.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale watched the lovers disappear, and
with mixed feelings, searched hastily for a dry
handkerchief. But all she dragged to light out
of her bag was a half sheet of note paper.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” she exclaimed. “Here’s that
note from Austin to me saying he was going to
San Francisco&mdash;what did you do with the last
page, my dear?” turning to Judith.</p>

<p>“The last page?” echoed Judith; she looked
as puzzled as she felt, and Jim Turner answered
the question for her.</p>

<p>“I found that paper in Austin’s bedroom, also,”
he volunteered. “It was just the half-sheet.
Why he brought it with him I don’t know, but
anyway I thought it a good plant and slipped the
page in the pocket of Miss Judith’s electric, knowing
some one would find it.” He turned to Mrs.
Hale who had moved a trifle nearer. “I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>your memorandum of Austin’s indebtedness to
you; I kept it for blackmailing purposes, but”&mdash;he
stopped abruptly, conscious that his voice was
a bit shaky.</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to disguise yourself as a
woman?” asked Ferguson.</p>

<p>“I used to play in amateur theatricals, and on
account of my small size, effeminate appearance
and voice was generally cast for a girl’s part,”
Turner explained. “I had to lay low after that
Shield’s affair&mdash;it meant fifteen years in the
‘pen’ if caught. Well,”&mdash;with his free hand he
dashed away the moisture which had gathered on
his forehead and felt his closely shaven head&mdash;“I’d
rather be hung than endure a living death.
Come on, Ferguson,” and without a backward
glance he departed in charge of the detective.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hale dropped down on the divan and her
expression caused her husband to hurry to her
side.</p>

<p>“Are you going to faint, Agatha?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>She looked at him vacantly before answering.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “how I shall ever
get over having my confidential maid turn out
to be a man,” and a burst of tears relieved her
overcharged feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>Richards left husband and wife together and
turned to speak to Judith, only to find her gone.
A look in the dining room showed that she was not
there, and racing upstairs two steps at a time,
he dashed into their boudoir. Judith turned from
the fireplace and looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Judith,” his pent-up worship of her spoke in
eye and voice, “what can I say to you, my darling,
my best beloved? Your faith, your loyalty&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are surpassed by yours,” she answered
softly, “dear heart of mine.”</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
